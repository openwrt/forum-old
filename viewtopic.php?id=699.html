					<p>Hi Guys !</p><p>I did some small add-on to Sam&#039;s GUI. You can found my work on this page <a href="http://isf.plec.ca/ipkg.html">http://isf.plec.ca/ipkg.html</a> and others details on what i&#039;m planning to code shortly. Some of my packages can be added to Sam&#039;s GUI (web-httpd and web-rdate). Some features are also missing (like PPPOE).</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Perhaps two branches: a small, minimal version, like now, plus a full-featured with webinterface, QoS, whatever..</p></blockquote></div><p>Like Sam tell me before, the best way to add new features is be using packages add-on. You only keep a small and minimal version that support all needs of OpenWRT original firmware. That way, it can be easily maintained and others coders can maintain personal small add-on.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Yeah great idea. Well can&#039;t we package modules ? I mean like the webmin does ?</p></blockquote></div><p>You can do it right now, if you build a package add-on you create a small ipkg that can be added with Sam&#039;s GUI. All you have to do is make sure his GUI is installed (use the preinst script in ipkg control). You can validate any others dependencies if you want.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>hello,<br />I&#039;ve builded to small gui-extensions to configure WAN&nbsp; &amp; OpenVpn<br />(https://festplattenbau.de/wrt/wan.tgz<br /> <a href="https://festplattenbau.de/wrt/openvpn.tgz)">https://festplattenbau.de/wrt/openvpn.tgz)</a><br />unpack it below /www/openwrt/packages to give a&nbsp; try</p></blockquote></div><p>I will certainly take a look at your work&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>This is a sweet project. I would like to see the modular approach taken for it as well. I know that the orignal devoplers are devolping for their CWN so I imagine it would be a fork of this. There are things that I don&#039;t need and things that I would like to see in this GUI so a modular approach would be ideal. Start off with the bare minium and add functionality as needed.</p><p>This GUI seems a little more stable and functional than the interface-wrt package.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would like to help with this project, too. I prefer a modular solution as well, but i know the freifunk.net people like a interface to easy let people be part of their net.<br />So i think a modular interface, but easy to pre-config would be an ideal solution to all parts of the community.</p><p>My first thoughts to design this GUI where:</p><p>1. I like the way interface-wrt is designed because of no need of other packages like php or perl.</p><p>2. Every part should be in a modular part, so should the base configs, so it is easyer to maintain.</p><p>3. My idea is to have only one index.html and every part should take place in a directory. So you can easy see which part is for which module. Like this<br />-www<br />--index.html<br />--base-network<br />---module.html<br />--base-wlan<br />---module.html<br />--pppoecd<br />---module.html<br />...<br />...<br />-- functions (maybe for general functions used by every module)</p><p>This way the index.html can parse this directory and build menus with name of the directory.<br />freifunk.net uses numbers like 11-pppoecd, 22-wlan ... to define the order in the menu.<br />I would prefer pppoecd.11, wlan.22 ... but this is a matter of taste.</p><p>4. maybe there is a possibility to use something like xml for the menus parsed by a script so you only have to put in the variables need to be saved. This can be parsed and combined with a template.</p><p>If there is a standard it is easy for everyone to give modules an easy config-page.</p><p>This is my first brainstorming on this issue, maybe these ideas are good, maybe not, but surely there are better ones, and i like to here these.</p><p>Gunni</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>major development changes in the Web GUI will not take place, until I integrated the project sources into the sourceforge CVS system (see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ff-firmware/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ff-firmware/</a>).</p><p>The main work to be done with this is: I maintain the Freifunk-Firmware project with a bunch of shell scripts until now. For a proper sourceforge integration, I need to convert to Makefile based build processing. Otherwise I have to write too much support emails. It is unlikely, that I can spend the time for this work prior to end of Feb 2005.</p><p>Until this date, everyone is invited to make new packages with included web gui based on the devpack I offer in the download directory <a href="http://styx.commando.de/sven-ola/ipkg/webpak/ff-devel.tgz">http://styx.commando.de/sven-ola/ipkg/w … -devel.tgz</a> Read the Readme and proceed as you like. Notes on that project:</p><p>* Focus is not to outrule SveaSoft or interface-wrt. Main purpose is and will be the easy deployment and setup for OLSR based MANET community projects.</p><p>* For other community projects, the look and feel of the Web GUI may be customized as well. Read the docs available in the Admin/Publish page for a conceptional overview.</p><p>* For easy development I use the XML editor (aka XXE on <a href="http://www.xmlmind.com">http://www.xmlmind.com</a>) to edit the content. This java program will run on any major OS. For the different languages, I customize the xhtml/xhtml.css for other bgcolors to show german, french and english content.</p><p>* If you have the time, please include sufficient online help content to any admin web page you add. Use the &lt;TR TITLE=&quot;!en:blabla!de:blabla&quot;&gt; notation for this. That is a matter of quality. Currently, I maintain english, french and german content. Surround language snippets you cannot translate by hash marks e.g. TITLE=&quot;!en:What the heck!de:###What the heck###&quot; or &lt;SPAN LANG=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is new&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN LANG=&quot;de&quot;&gt;###This is new###&lt;/SPAN&gt; for later translation.</p><p>Regards, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Sven,</p><p>I absolutely love your work with the Friefunk Firmware.&nbsp; It is likely I will use it as a base for a firmware for the Melbourne Wireless group.</p><p>I would modify it as follows (keeping it all open source, of course):<br />* I intend to connect another AP to the WRT54GS&#039; WAN port and sell them together as an outdoor, dual-radio node.<br />* I would like to add a webpage to control packet filtering and NAT between the LAN interface and the Wireless and WAN interfaces.<br />* Melbourne Wireless doesn&#039;t really do Mesh networking as such - we&#039;re more of a fixed-wireless group.&nbsp; So I would swap OLSR for Quagga or BIRD and a (hopefully) simple webpage for basic OSPF and BGP configuration.<br />That&#039;s the basic minimum features.&nbsp; As time goes on I&#039;d like to integrate Frottle and ChilliSpot into the firmware - provided they could all fit in the WRT54GS flash RAM.</p><p>I would try to keep it modular, but I do want it to be as easy to use as possible - which may require tight integration of the various software elements.</p><p>I have created a FreeNet Router Project wiki page here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.freenetworks.org/index.cgi/FreeNetRouterProject">http://wiki.freenetworks.org/index.cgi/ … terProject</a></p><p>I&#039;ve listed the various software and hardware options available, and Friefunk Firmware definitely gets a mention, as does OpenEmbedded and the MeshCube. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Soon I will create a wiki page on the Melbourne Wireless site detailing a localised version of the FreeNet Router Project.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Dan</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Dan,</p><p>absolutely nothing to say against not using OLSR. Let me express some comments on that topic anyway:</p><p>- Everyone needs another firewall config <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> For this reason, the customized /etc/init.d/S45firewall is part of the freifunk-olsr.ipk package. I just need to move the OLSR admin page into that packet in the next releases - it is until now part of freifunk-webadmin.ipk. Until that, just overwrite /etc/init.d/S45firewall with your own version and place an exit command in /etc/init.d/S53olsrd. I am not using shorewall because the OLSR needs are a little bit different...</p><p>- Consider using cheaper devices for that double bundle. Two WAP54g devices will do - they do have only one RJ45 ether port.</p><p>- For a more customized view of the web admin create a new template and use the template concept as explained in the Admin/Publish page. The same template can be used later on for the complete version of the web admin pages for your project. As pointed out earlier, I dont publish the complete sources until end-of-feb2005 within the sourceforge project migration step. If you are ready to deploy earlier I will provide you with the rest of the webadmin page sources if necessary. Until that, the ff-devel.tgz sample will do.</p><p>- Create new packages as needed. Create a new master package e.g. &quot;melbourne-wireless.ipk&quot; which mentions your customized packages in the dependencies. Then it will be possible to burn the freifunk-firmware and add your customizations simply by changing /etc/ipkg.conf and issue &quot;ipkg install melbourne-wireless&quot;. Another opportunity will be to install plain OpenWRT and issue the same command. For this you need to mention &quot;freifunk-webadmin&quot; in the dependencies too.</p><p>Regards, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d like to use a proper distribution based on OpenWRT for what I&#039;m doing (wireless mesh - currently each router is set up by hand, based on the wildcatmesh package). </p><p>Freifunk seems like it could soon do the job... I am currently using openVPN to tunnel from the nodes to the internet gateway, so that is why I can&#039;t use Freifunk now.</p><p>Configuring openVPN (actually the SSL certificates) is a real pain to do manually - sometimes the certificates don&#039;t work at all; and this week apparently all my certificates expired.</p><p>Also, on the subject of OLSR vs OSPF, I&#039;d only say that you should at least test the performance of OLSR before choosing. The latest OLSR has link-quality extensions specifically designed to work well in a wireless (read &quot;high packet loss&quot;) environment. Obviously this is only beneficial if nodes have multiple routes between them.</p><p>Oik</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi OIK,</p><p>just give the OLSR protocol a shot. Here in Berlin we have around 30-80 OLSR nodes in our mesh network and it works great. A community member developed the ETX/QOS enhancements for OLSR and since we use that enhancements we have stable routes while members dynamically join and leave - which explains also my node number estimate...</p><p>On my wishlist, theres a openVPN package anncounced already. I would greatly appreciate if someone will do that job and pack together an openVPN package with web page for administration. You may refer to another community mebers web page also: <a href="http://freifunk.net/wiki/OpenVPN">http://freifunk.net/wiki/OpenVPN</a>. </p><p>Rgds, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>Sven,</p><p>Can you tell me what % of CPU is required to run OLSR with 60 nodes? The one nagging doubt I had was that the&nbsp; author of OLSR measured the CPU load at 1-2% for only 3 nodes.</p><p>Also, how do you encrypt/secure the traffic on your mesh?</p><p>Oik</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>most people <em>dream</em> of mesh networks bigger than 100 nodes. There was a conference at the end of 2004 (21C3) in Berlin - and there where around 80 nodes in the net. CPU load rises up to 80 percent with debug switched on. CPU load is around 30 percent with no debug - for a plain WRT54g. According to the OLSR devs, this is due to extensive searches of linear routing tables which is to be optimized in the future...</p><p>Rgds, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>
