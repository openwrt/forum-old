I have the converted CA42 connected to the serial port but have not got a clue which file to upload. I would rather not brick my router/modem but this is so obvious that I simply cannot see how to do it. Linksys Web firmware loader rejects all and if I stop the serial to enable upload firmware then it reject it too, as for TFTP no success either - AAAH, which file?<br/>John</p></blockquote></div><p>Please look into <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19601">this thread</a>, Virus posted a link to a running firmware.

					<p>I&#039;ve managed to add the pid2 to the OpenWRT image, so that a reboot of the device is possible now.<br/>You find my patches for the imagetag and Makefile <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8938">here</a>.<br/>Just apply them in order to svn trunk (don&#039;t know if they work with any other branch).</p><p>They should produce two new images called openwrt-WAG160Nv2-annex_a-squashfs-web.bin&nbsp; and <br/>openwrt-WAG160Nv2-annex_b-squashfs-web.bin. You are able to either upload them using the vendor<br/>firmware web interface or use the download mode of the bootloader and a sercomm tool,<br/>e.g. the <a href="https://github.com/jal2/WAG160Nv2">Linux</a> one.<br/> As the images contain a zeroed CFE area there is a slight chance that some other version of the flash update cgi<br/>may overwrite the bootloader with the zeros (mine did not). In that case you need JTAG to revive the board. So the Linux sercomm tool<br/>may be a bit safer. It&#039;s always a good idea to backup the whole flash (especially the ath_data area) as a first step.</p><p>With the above patch we are restricted to a squashfs rootfs and sizeof(kernel) + sizeof(rootfs) must be greater than 2MByte.</p><p>EDIT: The OpenWRT image overwrote the ath_data section, we need to add it to the flash layout of the WAG160Nv2. Be sure to<br/>have a backup of it before trying to run OpenWRT!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jal2</strong> on 26 Feb 2011, 03:16)</p>
