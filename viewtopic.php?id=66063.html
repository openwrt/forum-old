					<p>Hi devs,</p><p>These AC600 USB Wifi adapters are fairly popular and cheap these days so I was wondering if anyone has been able to get them to work with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I understand that performance on these chips aren&#039;t great but I think for the price and easy availability, it would be something that many people would be interested in getting to work.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking to add a second wifi adapter for my road warrior router.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen this chipset in various products:<br />-- MediaTek MT7610U (RT2860)<br />-- EDIMax AC600 Wireless Dual-Band Mini USB Adapter<br />-- ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-AC600 Wi-Fi Adapter (USB-AC51)</p><p>EDIMax provides the linux drivers on their website:<br /><a href="http://us.edimax.com/edimax/download/download/data/edimax/us/download/for_home/wireless_adapters/wireless_adapters_ac600_dual-band/ew-7811utc">http://us.edimax.com/edimax/download/do … ew-7811utc</a></p><p>The driver in the package:<br />rtl8821AU_linux_v4.3.19.5_17672.20160506_BTCOEX20150921-58.tar.gz</p><p>lsusb lists the device as:<br />Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0e8d:7610 MediaTek Inc.</p><p>Open source driver I found:<br /><a href="https://github.com/ulli-kroll/rtl8821au">https://github.com/ulli-kroll/rtl8821au</a></p><p>I have tried all of the rt28xx drivers that are currently available in CC to no avail.</p><p>Thanks for any response.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mt7610 dont have open driver as i know, you can try to find proprietary mt7610_ap driver, but as it doesnt support cfg80211 you have to write several custom scripts to bring it up</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 8 Jul 2016, 12:10)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; So the device I have is a Mediatek MT7610.&nbsp; Without a mac80211 driver, does this mean it can&#039;t be configured through LUCI or are there deeper ramifications?</p>									</div>
