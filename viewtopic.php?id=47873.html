I checked their BBS. Many users complain that they put the Router firmware on the Hard disk. That cause the problem for the hard disc. And also complain they didn&#039;t focus on the basic function of the Router. even you can&#039;t do the port forwarding at this router. I m not a IT geek, but those comments make me regret to buy it.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks xanadunwh! you&#039;re a lifesaver!</p><p>I followed your steps and have now restored my router with the original hardrive. I might try in a few days to swap the hardrive out with a lower capacity one or I might look into a sata/usb converter and see if I can put a usb flash in the sata slot!</p>									</div>
