					<p>Hello all,<br />&nbsp; By almost any measurement (especially OpenWRT) I am a total Noob.&nbsp; That said, I am amazed at how much I&#039;ve actually been able to get work (which speaks more to the work of the open source community in making such complex projects understandable to somebody with very little expertise, than to my own skill).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; It seems that I have finally reached a point where what I am trying to accomplish has not been extensively documented at least on the level of what somebody like me can understand.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to outline my goals as specifically as possible and also list some of the materials I have available to me in case anyone has any suggestions.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve been working with Arduino for years and more recently started learning Linux on Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; My original intent was to use the WR-703n as a complement to a larger home automation network consisting of multiple arduinos connected through XBee to a Gateway on the Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; But once I discovered OpenWRT I couldn&#039;t help but to dig deeper.<br />&nbsp; I found OpenWRT through <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-set-up-OpenWRT-on-a-pocket-router-WR703N/">this instructable</a> and managed to get it set up so I could access the Luci web interface through the default ip gateway 192.168.1.1&nbsp; This would&#039;ve been fine if I didn&#039;t have to take things up a notch by replacing my old D-Link Gamerlounge Router with an Asus RT-N16 which I ended up flashing with the latest &quot;All in one&quot; TomatoUSB build by Shibby.&nbsp; The Tomato interface is absolutely amazing!&nbsp; The only problem is I don&#039;t know how to set it up to use the WR-703n as a client since they are using two different Linux distributions.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find anything on either TomatoUSB forums (which has notoriously bad documentation anyway) or the OpenWRT forums (which has the best documentation) about connecting routers running two different systems.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found many comments saying TomatoUSB doesn&#039;t have support for other wifi clients&nbsp; but it appears this has changed with the latest Shibby builds.&nbsp; There are so many different options available that its worth my while to explore each one just to learn how they work.<br />&nbsp; Anybody have any ideas?&nbsp; This has all been enormous fun for me and I view it all as a learning experience so there&#039;s no urgency to my question.&nbsp; Just thought I would poll the community for some ideas.&nbsp; If there is another thread or forum where this question should be, I will happily withdraw the topic...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank You All For Getting Me This Far!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank You!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess one of the consequences of learning about affordable embedded devices like the WR703n, Raspberry Pi etc... is that one&#039;s ability to amass a whole lot of toys can easily outpace the ability to actually use them...&nbsp; So thank you again for the references.&nbsp; I think I have a better idea of how to explain what I&#039;m trying to do now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I actually have three routers which should be compatible with some flavor of Linux.&nbsp; I have the WR703n, which I originally intended to use as a sort of replacement for an Arduino Ethernet Shield after reading this Instructable-<a href="http://https:/http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-set-up-OpenWRT-on-a-pocket-router-WR703N/">https:/http://www.instructables.com/id/ … er-WR703N/</a><br />&nbsp; I have an Asus RT-N16&nbsp; flashed with a recent Shibby build of TomatoUSB as my main router and I also have a WL-520gu which I bought with the intention of controlling a webcam with an arduino for Pan/Tilt control. I&#039;ll be flashing this with OpenWRT once I resolve some of the bugs in the serial port communication (I got as far as soldering a serial header following the tutorial on <a href="http://https:://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-3-hacking-the-asus-wl-520gu/">mightyohm.com</a> and can read some characters on Coolterminal for Mac through the <a href="http://www.makershed.com/Uartsbee_V4_Xbee_FTDI_Adapter_p/mkseeed16.htm">uARTsbee</a> adapter I usually use with my Arduinos.&nbsp; But I still need to make some adjustments on my terminal program I think before I can reliably read the serial data).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In theory my goal all along has been to set up a Wireless Temperature Sensor Network around the house using XBee Series 2 radios attached to various arduino configurations for controlling various responses to temperature fluctuations.&nbsp; Whether or not this is what is actually accomplished is almost irrelevent as I&#039;m just using it as an excuse to test various networking configurations of the Internet of Things.&nbsp; I found OpenWRT in the process of trying to set up a Base Station for the XBee radios to connect to a web interface.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; As it stands now I still need to set up a gateway for my network of XBee radios.&nbsp; I can use the Raspberry Pi with an expansion board on the GPIO pins and either a python script or the recent beta version of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/">xig</a> released.&nbsp; But now I&#039;m considering using the WL-520gu as the XBee Gateway (if I can get past the serial port bugs) which would free the WR703n for use with the Pan/Tilt Webcam if it has enough RAM.<br />&nbsp; After reading through the overview of terms I&#039;m thinking that what I&#039;m looking for is a Client Bridge set up for the WR703n in order to take advantage of its small size when connecting the webcam to the internet.&nbsp; I know there&#039;s a client bridge setting on the Luci Configuration interface but I also read in the Instructable documentation that the webcam script requires so much RAM that there wouldnt be enough space to install Luci.&nbsp; I have a long ways to go before I can configure a router to work with a webcam using only the CLI, so if I could figure out how to set up a Client Bridge mode from the main router on TomatoUSB, then I thought that maybe it will save me some of the confusion. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So thats the long and the short of what I&#039;m trying to do with it.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the actual goal is simply to learn about networking and the Internet of Things, so whether or not I can measure temperatures or stream a webcam is not necessarily important as I long as I figure out a thing or two along the way.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry for the biographical details, somehow I have to write it all out to figure out how all the pieces fit together...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank You Once Again For Your Help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Little steps.<br />Try setting up a client bridge with luci and then see if you can access the net with your mac attached to the 703.<br />If that is OK, the next step would be to create an extroot on the 703 with a usb hub and flash card. Now you will have plenty of space to _install_ stuff. <br />Finally, if you are running low on RAM then there are to options: use a usb HDD and create swap partition, or upgrade the RAM chip.<br />I do not advocate the latter unless you are very handy with soldering!</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is my writeup of using openWrt for a pan and tilt camera.&nbsp; My devices were NSLU2 for openWrt and Picaxe for microcontroller, but the idea is the same with WL-520gU or WR703N and arduino:</p><p><a href="http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/showthread.php?13705">http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/showthread.php?13705</a></p><p>Grey day today here in Nova Scotia, you can see at <a href="http://www.lyzby.com/cam.html">http://www.lyzby.com/cam.html</a></p><p>Here is a thread on some of the many things you can do with openwrt acting as the operating system for a little computer:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23114">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23114</a></p><p>Among the enduser tasks an openWrt router can perform:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1.

(As of 121204, works as client from stock for many devices, including WL-520gU and WR703n.)
2.  Webcam server--UVC webcam with mjpg-streamer and motion can be run
3.  Music player--with a hub, usb flash or usb hd can be attached along with a usb sound device.
4.  Internet radio--can stream internet radio
5.  Internet link for sensors--can talk through usb serial to picaxe or arduino or stamp microprocessors and can display a web page to monitor sensors or control devices.  The WL-520 has a lot of space inside the case, and is &quot;solder-ready&quot;.
6.  Always-on internet data concentrator--enduser programs written in Lua or other language can constantly monitor the web and send alerts or present amalgomated web pages
7.  Remote computer for robot--wireless bridging allows this feature
8.  &quot;Tweeter&quot; or text messanger for emergency conditions
9.  In-car computer for simple tasks
10.  Cell phone controller for text-messaging of sensed events.
11.  Install to usb/sd flash for additional applications

					<p>Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for!&nbsp; I really don&#039;t understand why people warned me against posting noob questions on Embedded Linux forums...&nbsp; You guys have been great!<br />&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m going to give the webcam package a whirl on the WR703n and possibly the WL-520gu if need be.<br />&nbsp; A couple questions-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. As soon as I send this message I&#039;m going to disconnect my wireless and plug in my WR703n via Ethernet and try to set up a client bridge.&nbsp; Since I access my main router through 192.168.1.1, it looks to make the most sense to follow the recommendation posted by lizby to put the wifi and lan on separate networks.&nbsp; Is there a way to make the configuration changes lizby posted in Luci?&nbsp; If not, how do I access the CLI?&nbsp; Via TELNET or SSH?&nbsp; And how would I TELNET or SSH in without first changing the ip since 192.168.1.1 is already being used by the Tomato Router?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; My pan/tilt webcam setup is nearly identical as the one lizby linked to (as far as the webcam, mount and two servos are concerned).&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the first step to communicating with any Microcontroller is adding the serial header.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, I got as far as adding a header and fabricating a pin-out adapter for the WL-520gu following the mightyohm.com instructions.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to use an FTDI adapter made by Seeed Studio called the uARTSbee (<a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/UartSBee_V4">http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/UartSBee_V4</a>) with the power switched to 3.3v.&nbsp; According to the tutorial (<a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-3-hacking-the-asus-wl-520gu/">http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/build … -wl-520gu/</a>)<br /> I should see a read out that looks like this-</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Decompressing..........done<br />CFE version 1.0.37 for BCM947XX (32bit,SP,LE)<br />Build Date: Thu Mar&nbsp; 6 10:05:04 CST 2008 (root@localhost.localdomain)<br />Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002,2003 Broadcom Corporation.<br />Initializing Arena<br />Initializing Devices.<br />Boot partition size = 131072(0x20000)<br />et0: Broadcom BCM47xx 10/100 Mbps Ethernet Controller 4.130.31.0<br />Total memory: 16384 KBytes</p></blockquote></div><p>When I connect to a terminal program on Ubuntu, nothing appears but using CoolTerm on Mac I&#039;m able to get something like this-<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;com&lt;ressing......done</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; and so forth, so it seems like its trying to read it but is having trouble with the characters.&nbsp; I have the port options set to 115200 baud 8N1, per the Mightyohm tutorial.&nbsp; Is anybody aware of any tricks to get the serial monitor working properly?&nbsp; Is the uARTSbee an appropriate FTDI adapter in this case?&nbsp; I&#039;d ask the manufacturer but Seeed Studio has notoriously bad support.</p><p>&nbsp; Also, I was about to ask about adding a serial header to the WR703n when I noticed somebody posted this excellent Instructable (<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/TL-WR703N-serial-port/?ALLSTEPS">http://www.instructables.com/id/TL-WR70 … /?ALLSTEPS</a>) just 3 days ago!&nbsp; I would&#039;ve asked if it was one of you guys but this thread started the day after!&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; So again, I can&#039;t thank you guys enough!&nbsp; and lizby...&nbsp; If all goes well, we&#039;ll have a Realtime Pan/Tilt view of Casco Bay in Maine to join your Nova Scotia view!

					<p>That instructable is quite radical, but neat at the same time. Personally I&#039;d go with fewer bits of HW, so I&#039;d go with the instructable, or the guides here in the forum.<br />Only thing to be really careful with is that the serial (and all other) pads lift really easily. So use hot glue to fix the connections.</p>									</div>

					<p>araner,</p><p>Since you have an address of 192.168.1.1 already on your network, you will need to change that on your openWrt device.&nbsp; I would guess you can do that with luci, but I don&#039;t use it, so can&#039;t be sure.&nbsp; Because of the conflict, you would have to disconnect from your network (wired and wireless) and connect a cable directly between your laptop and the device--either wl-520gU or WR703N.&nbsp; Your laptop needs to have a fixed ip in the 192.168.1.n range, where n=2 to 254.&nbsp; With that set up you should be able to connect via a browser to luci, or to connect via telnet (using putty or the like).</p><p>Once you connect through telnet, you need to use passwd to set a password--then you can sign in with ssh (and telnet will be disabled for security reasons).&nbsp; Either while signed in with telnet or ssh, you can edit /etc/config/network with vi to change the fixed ip to something you prefer (for instance, not in the range which dhcp on your router provides).&nbsp; Make sure you set up &quot;option gateway 192.168.1.1&quot; and &quot;option dns 8.8.8.8&quot; (that&#039;s google dns, likely to always be available).</p><p>When you reboot you should be able to connect to your network.&nbsp; Check the wiki for wireless connection.</p><p>As far as serial goes, the serial on the wl-520gU and WR703N is the console, so without fiddling, it is not very useful for communication with a microcontroller.&nbsp; I use these usb/serial dongles:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-USB-2-0-to-TTL-UART-6PIN-Module-Serial-Converter-CP2102-STC-PRGMR-Free-cable-/310511987503?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item484bf4eb2f">http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-USB-2-0-to- … 484bf4eb2f</a></p><p>Or similar--search ebay for &quot;usb serial cp2102&quot;.&nbsp; PL2303 and CH-340/Ch-341 dongles also work.&nbsp; All tend to be cheaper than ftdi (which is otherwise fine).</p><p>For the WR703N you will need a hub if you are going to use wireless--there appears to be a bug which causes usb-serial to hang when wireless is used unless a hub is used.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need that anyway if you want to add a webcam and usb storage.</p><p>I personally would not fiddle (again) with a serial mod on a WR703N.&nbsp; The TPin and TPout pads are very small and very delicate--hard to solder and easy to pull up.&nbsp; The usb dongle is much easier, and, if your time is worth anything, cheaper.</p><p>You would need modded serial if you mangle the WR703N, but with failsafe, that&#039;s fairly hard to do.&nbsp; The WL-520gU is almost bulletproof, since you can always reflash it.&nbsp; The serial console is useful for instances when you have done something to the network configuration--been there.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what your problem is--sure you&#039;ve got a good ground connection--on both ends?</p><p>Re Casco Bay, I&#039;ve taken the ferry from Portland to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, many times.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that it&#039;s no longer running.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 4 Dec 2012, 22:06)</p>

					<p>Thank you again for your excellent advice.&nbsp; I wish I had read it in time before I impulsively went ahead with the mod spelled out in that Instructable I linked to earlier.&nbsp; I think I actually managed to make all the connections correctly and when I do a resistance test on the header pins the right pin is shorted to ground and everything... BUT...&nbsp; Well... Like I said I REALLY REALLY wish I had read your warning before doing that stupid mod!<br />&nbsp; Oh well...&nbsp; Thats why I chose the WR703n to make the experiemental mods on... No big loss, if its indeed a loss...<br />&nbsp; So on to the WL-520gu...&nbsp; I tested the ground connection with a multimeter and it seems to be doing fine.&nbsp; My guess is it has something to do with the uARTsbee I&#039;m using as my Serial-USB Converter.&nbsp; It should be up to that task but seeing as its actually a serial&gt;miniusb&gt;usb converter with dual settings for 3.3v/5v my guess is there&#039;s something going on within all those conversions...&nbsp; I guess its finally time to get a real Serial/USB converter like the one you linked to...&nbsp; I might as well spring for another WR703n too...<br />&nbsp; RE:NS-Maine Ferry-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Efforts are underway to bring the ferry back possibly as early as 2013-<br /> <a href="http://www.nsusaferry.com/2-general/42-government-to-put-out-an-official-call-for-proposals">http://www.nsusaferry.com/2-general/42- … -proposals</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, the main reason I am researching open source hardware and embedded applications is to find low cost means of improving small public transportation services in Maine.&nbsp; If your interested, the projects are documented here-<a href="http://www.humblehackers.wikispaces.com">www.humblehackers.wikispaces.com</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know what to say about your serial connection on the WL-520gU.&nbsp; You&#039;re certainly close to be getting the output that you are.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done that mod about 5 times on WL-520gUs and WL-500gPv2s--with success.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure that the usb/serial dongle I pointed to is correct for linking to the 3V3 serial console on either device.&nbsp; The dongle provides 5V and 3V3 supplies, but the actual serial out may be 5V, which would damage the device.&nbsp; I&#039;ll test it when I get a chance.&nbsp; (It&#039;s fine for linking to a 5V microprocessor.)</p><p>For connection to 3V3 devices, I use a usb-ttl serial dongle which allows you to choose whether the output is 3V3 or 5V.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find the exact one I use.&nbsp; This appears to be like it, but neither the documentation nor the photo is good enough to tell whether the 3-pin header is for making that selection.&nbsp; I suspect it is:<br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-2-0-to-TTL-UART-Module-Serial-Device-Converter-s-/170656254319?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27bbe7c96f">http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-2-0-to-TTL- … 27bbe7c96f</a></p><p>Good luck with your transportation efforts.&nbsp; That document shows quite a bit of effort.&nbsp; If you can make it happen in Maine, it might be possible in Nova Scotia, tho the population density outside of Halifax is even lower.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 5 Dec 2012, 20:31)</p>

					<p>The uARTsbee also has a setting for both 5V and 3.3v on which I&#039;ve been using 3.3...&nbsp; Is this wrong?&nbsp; If so it would certainly explain the trouble I&#039;m having!<br />&nbsp; Seeing as you checked out my transit projects... I wonder what potential there might be in adding a GPS module to a portable router like the WR703n or anything else that works with 3G as a tracking device?&nbsp; When I first started working on the project I could find a couple similar projects (mostly for use in cars) that would use Arduinos, but now I&#039;m starting to see a lot more being done with Raspberry Pi&#039;s...&nbsp; I wonder if it would be possible to do with an Embedded Linux device?</p><p>&nbsp; Brief OT foray (though it could easily become On-Topic...)-<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve always thought that Metro Portland possibly has more in common with Metro Halifax than it does with any other city in the US.&nbsp; There are several reasons why US Census data can paint an inaccurate picture of Portland when compared to anywhere else.&nbsp; One reason is that New England has a completely different Census reporting system of County level stats because Counties don&#039;t really hold much weight in NE...&nbsp; Population density is another tough nut to crack.&nbsp; When most planners look at the population density of Metro Portland they equate it with &quot;suburban&quot; density, but there are serious qualitative differences between the Greater Portland region and say... Western NJ...&nbsp; Some suburban-esque development exists for sure, but for the most part the cities that adhere to traditional boundaries will have extraordinary density in the town center, but then rural farmland within the same city limits.&nbsp; Portland is even more defined in this regard because its density is geographically defined by the Peninsula.&nbsp; From what I gather, Halifax is possibly the closest comparison in this regard.&nbsp; Also, if &quot;City-Data.com&quot; can be taken as a trusted source, it appears that Halifax has a significantly higher share of people who use transit (15% vs I think under 10% in Portland)...&nbsp; I wonder if this has to do with quality of service?&nbsp; Maybe its just a case of &quot;the grass is always greener...&quot;&nbsp; But I&#039;m hoping that even small technological innovations can improve accessibility enough to bring our share up in line with the rest of the planet...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, GPS with the WR703N should work (emphasis on &quot;should&quot; rather than &quot;does&quot;).&nbsp; I was in fact about to make another attempt today to get it working with a Microsoft serial gps module which I picked up on ebay.&nbsp; I first tried it a year ago--it would start to communicate and then die.&nbsp; I am now thinking that the problem might well have been with the WR703N usb serial/wireless issue which I just read about a few days ago.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try it on a hub.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know how it goes.</p><p>I don&#039;t know enough about the Portland or Halifax bus services to compare, other than that my stepson uses the bus a lot and doesn&#039;t much like it (mainly because he has to take a local bus into town to catch an express bus back out of town past his departure point to get to the farther-out place he wants to reach).&nbsp; There&#039;s not much farmland around here, but lots of forest, and very little service past the urbanized area.</p><p>Higher share of transit usage in Halifax may be due to it&#039;s larger population, therefore greater urbanization--~250,000 versus what, ~70,000?</p>									</div>
