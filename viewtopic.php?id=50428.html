					<p>dear projects,</p><p>what you are trying to do is to fit minimal gui on minimal 4MB flash router. Is it possible? Yes. I have done it. Is it possible with LUCI? I would think so. I have never used LUCI on Openwrt, since I like doing most of the stuff using CLI. And since I am a programmer, its pretty easy for me to write custom stuff. That is why I like Openwrt so much, its like I am programming in Linux, which it is. </p><p>Any how, I have previously used DDWRT. it use to fit along with all its GUI on 4MB flash routers, so that is why I think Openwrt with LUCI would also fit on 4MB router.&nbsp; However, if you are trying to do some customisation of your own, then you need to be able to do some programming. The minimal configuration that I have used is mini_httpd with haserl. Haserl can do most of the basic stuff, but you gotta know ash in order to write cgi scripts in haserl. </p><p>Although I have not personally used uhttpd, but I think you could possibly use that along with lua scripting. However I am not sure how the lua is interfaced with uhttpd. Is it more like traditional CGI, or is it more like custom interface, that you will need to figure out. If its not some standard CGI like interface, then you will have to learn it. LUCI does it, so there should be good examples on how its done. If uhttpd supports CGI scripts, then you can also combine uhttpd with haserl. So uhttpd could be your second option.</p><p>Both of these option would require less than 100KB space and I know 4MB routers have more than this with standard openwrt firmware installed.</p><p>By the way, I am not clear what you are exactly trying to do. Even if you do not need gui, the above combo can be used to POST data using a browser or your own program which can do HTTP post. You can possibly use netcat and do your own custom tcp or udp packet to do what ever you are trying to do. It might help if you show us your /etc/config/network file.</p><p>BTW, I am guessing that you are trying to make 703 router use wireless wan? The user with cell phone would connect to the 703 using wifi, and then instruct the 703 to connect to yet another wifi in order to get net connection. And hence the ssid/key comes into play. Is that what it is?</p><p>And exactly how much writeable space is left on your device?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ron</strong> on 2 May 2014, 23:25)</p>

					<p>OpenWrt on the TL-WR703N cannot provide a gui: this router has no graphic card, so you can&#039;t get anything &quot;graphic&quot;.</p><p>The best you can get is a web-based user interface, but this supposes that your cell phone is connected to the same wireless network as your router in the first place...</p><p>So, basically:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>the TL-WR703N when in &quot;firstboot&quot; state provides a wireless AP with a distinctive SSID (some name with a unique suffix is better if you may have several routers in this state at the same time, suggested is a MAC address-based suffix)</p></li><li><p>the cell phone user disconnects itself from the local wireless AP and associates itself with the TL-WR703N AP</p></li><li><p>the router is running a DHCP server and assigns a dynamic address to the newly connected cell phone</p></li><li><p>the router provides a simple web server and presents an HTML page containing a form to fill in</p></li><li><p>the cell phone user fetches this page from the router static IP address using a web browser</p></li><li><p>the user enters the local Wireless SSID, encryption method and pass phrase and submit back the form to the router</p></li><li><p>the router needs to get the form fields in a program from the web server (this can be in a Bash script using the server CGI (Common Gateway Interface) mechanism), for example</p></li><li><p>the program on the router switches to client mode on the given wireless network, using the user-provided information: it will receive a dynamically-assigned IP address from the local wireless network AP</p></li><li><p>the cell phone user associates itself back to the local wireless network: both devices are now on the same wireless network</p></li><li><p>if the user wants to talk to the TL-WR703N router, its dynamically-assigned IP address would need to be found by looking into the local wireless network AP assigned DHCP leases</p></li></ol><p>Thus, to answer your question, you will need&nbsp; a minimal web server at least: this can be netcat or its minimal version integrated into the busybox single executable, or a separate LIGHT server, such as uhttpd or again the httpd server available into busybox to keep it very small. Please, don&#039;t even THINK about using Apache for this purpose <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Then you can just have a simple Bash script (using the busybox built-in bash, of course) to serve the single HTML page/form using the server&#039;s CGI mechanism. Again, don&#039;t even THINK about using PHP/Perl/Ruby/Javascript here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>As you can see, there is not a single option here. The main point is to remember that you run on a CPU/memory-constrained embedded device, and that the common desktop/server solutions do not apply directly, you will need to carefully weight each piece of software that you put on the device and try to squeeze the maximum out of it!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 2 May 2014, 23:09)</p>

					<p>Ron, the 703 will not be used as a router. No router/firewall (openwrt) or any related stuff including luci are installed on the 703.

					<p>ok. 1.4MB&nbsp; is a lot of space to do what you want to do. 703n has only single RJ45 connection. So assuming you connect via wire, then the only way for any one to connect to it would be the wifi. And the only way you can ever connect to wifi to begin with is if you already have a predefined SSID The default Openwrt will do all this for you. Now if you simply want to change the SSID, but dont want LUCI, you can use the httpd server with haserl. Write a simple CGI script, which can take input from user and set the required UCI configuration. However, users seldom change SSIDs, perhaps just once.</p>									</div>

					<p>Right, the user would know the SSID but they would need to enter in the key as well. </p><p>On the cable side, it&#039;s been pretty easy.

The TL-WR703N can then stop being an AP and authenticate itself as a wireless client to the final wireless network, getting an IP address in the way, and then only can it send an email to you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 3 May 2014, 10:45)</p>
