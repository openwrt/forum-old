					<p>Hi,</p><p>a few toughts about meshing protocols.</p><p>- OLSRD: where the plugins are gone? (I&#039;m using kamikaze and there&#039;s the olsrd package only)</p><p>- OLSRD: I&#039;m testing an unofficial 5.0 version that includes 18 patches that &quot;improve performance and fix bugs&quot; published here <a href="https://www.open-mesh.net/optimized-link-state-routing-deamon">https://www.open-mesh.net/optimized-lin … ing-deamon</a> (the website is the group of Freifunk developers that are developing batman; they know what they are doing). Is there a chance to use that package instead of the official 4.10 tarball?</p><p>- BATMAN: In the last months I&#039;ve been testing the batman protocol and it is very good; I think is mature enough to include it in the packages. If any of the developers is available to add it, I can clean my makefile and send it...</p><p>- Netsukuku: same as batman. The code is somewhat a work-in-progress, but it works very well and I think it would be good to spread it as I&#039;m sure that it will be a good mesh platform (fractal topology, very low resouces usage, etc). I think that including it in the openwrt packages could help its developers and boost the project development speed.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Wallace78</p>									</div>

Last time I tested was a bit unstable but it could be my fault as I made some dirty hacks to force it compile, and was segfaulting. Then I didn&#039;t have time to go over (at that time my priority was to fiddle with nbd to include mesh capabilities in his qos-scripts package).<br />The good thing is that it has a very low resources consumption (you can route the entire IPv6 address space with a 30? consumer router!), the backside of the medal is that it needs some time to stabilize routes; this is fair for fixed nodes, very bad for mobile nodes (but they suggest to mix it with OLSR somewhere in their docs; and it is what I&#039;m going to do into the meganetwork and webif-meganetwork packages). They also developed other tools beacouse it&#039;s not just a routing protocol; it has a sort of anonymous dns, it assigns IP addresses almost randomly, there&#039;s a gateway to &quot;standard networks&quot; that allow to create VPNs over the internet to build up a big virtual network including all the netsukuku nodes around the world... and more...</p><p>I don&#039;t have settings to post as I tested it more than one year ago and I know that the Freaklab guys changed many things in the whiletime (they are going into the v2 of their fractal routing protocol, QSPN).<br />Anyway I&#039;m in contact with them and I&#039;ll commit package and webif pages soon in the XWrt repository to let the end-users play with it, hoping that this will help netsukuku developers to speed up their work...<br />But I&#039;d like to complete the webif-olsr package (Freifunk -&gt; X-Wrt) first as I did it in RC4 and now has to be reviewed to make it work on Kamikaze (it is already uci-fied, and scripts are functional, only webif is broken; you can find it in XWrt repo if you want to contribute). It&#039;s a pity to have it laying there unused. Once it is finished I&#039;ll go (or Blaxwan, that is doing all the job in these days!) on Netsukuku again.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>yapoo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>BTW, BATMAN was added in packages. Thank you, thepeople and Blaxwan.<br />I&#039;ll try it.</p></blockquote></div><p>I just committed also the X-Wrt package webif-batman package (entirely made by blaxwan on meganetwork.org svn). If you use XWrt (or webif^2) you can get webif-mesh (it&#039;s a temp package, I&#039;ll merge it into webif^2 once the mesh stuff is properly tested) and webif-batman package to have a web interface to batman.</p><p>ciao</p><p>Wallace</p><p>P.s.: thanks thepeople; I remove the batman package from X-Wrt as now is included in OpenWrt</p>									</div>
