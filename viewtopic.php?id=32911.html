					<p>Hello everybody!<br />So here is my small question:</p><p>I would like to run Openwrt with a web-interface (Luci), QoS, and have an openVPN server for WAN connections (I have static IP from my provider).<br />I tried to install openvpn package on my DIR-300, but there is not enough space (Only 256kB left).<br />Do you have any suggestions - which router should I buy, or how much memory should it have to run OpenWRT with this desirable configuration?</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Artem</p>									</div>

					<p>Try this page from the WIKI (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a>). I do not recommend a router with less than 8mb flash. Of course you can use a router with only 4mb if it has a spare USB port with an external flash storage card used as EXTROOT (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot/extroot.theory">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extro … oot.theory</a>).</p>									</div>

					<p>the suggestion using the old release just because the basesystem of openwrt grew bigger ever release so it quite hard to fit all packages the OP needs in 4MB flash with backfire 10.3.1. But there may be a chance to achieve it with kamikaze. <br />But I wouldn&#039;t suggest this, I normally would suggest building your own image with everthing included, and if it&#039;s to big think about if luci is really mandatory. Openvpn and qos fits fine in 4MB but openvpn, qos and luci is getting tricky. </p><p>and I would like to comment the hardwarecrypto-advice. the wgt634u is only able to use the hardware-crypto-engine for DES, so forget this one. And you won&#039;t be happy with the wl-500g premium either (I tried this some time ago, I got it working, but as openvpn isn&#039;t running in kernelspace there is a lot of copying in ram, so I ended up with a slower encryption than with softwareencryption). And an half decent cpu (400Mhz) would be enough for at least 5Mbit/s, or even more.&nbsp; So only consider hardware-encryption, if you have a fast (and synchron) internetconnection and then get a some hardware-crypto-solution that&#039;s really working and not this broadcom-stuff.</p>									</div>

					<p>eleon216,<br />Thank you very much for your reply. You get in details, and this is really what I was asking about.<br />I am realy affraid of using a router without Luci, as I am not sure, that I can do all needed adjustments. Such as openvpn-server setup and even port-forwarding. I am not so good at iptables.. This is my shame.<br />And what about the speed of the Internet connection for computers inside LAN?<br />Now I have an access for each computer (2 computers) trough my router to the Internet. If I will run OpenVPN server to connect to this network with my laptop to the WAN port, will it reduce the speed of the Internet connection to this users inside existing LAN?</p><p>Thank you also with the advice regarding asus router. I was just about to buy it!!<br />Now I will think twice.<br />So, what is your advice then? If I am not able to use hardware-encruuption: should I just buy any router with a fast CPU and that will be enough? Assuming this logic, I need DIR-320 with 240MHz at least?</p><br /><p>jow,<br />could I kindly ask you to provide me with this pre-build image? The thing is, I allready tried two times to build it, and had a non-workable device. I asked another gue in the forum, he did it for me.. Or if I will not bother you - may I send you few PM during the compiling process?</p><p>Kind Regards<br />Artem</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>jow already tried it, and 3,6 MB look like it should be possible to fit all packages in a recent (trunk or backfire) image. It&#039;s still not much space left for something else because 320kB are used but the bootloader and stuff, but it should be possible, and I would recommend this option. <br />but you have to include everthing in the highly compressed readonly filessystem (squashfs), there is not enough flash to install it to the (less compressed) jffs2-partion afterwards. <br />You have to create your own image. you could build (compile) everthing <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a><br />or just create your own firmwareimage with precompiled packages with the image-builder <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai … e.generate</a></p><p>so it should be possible to run this on your existing hardware. <br />You only have to consider new hardware is you experience preformance-issues. The 180MHz CPU of the DIR-300 is quite slow, and encryption is a quite cpu-intensive task so you shouldn&#039;t expect to run a 50MBit-VPN-connection. <br />But if you have an asychron internet-connection. e.g. in my case I have a ADSL line with 8Mbit download and 768kbit upload. And I use vpn to get files from my pc at home when I&#039;m somewhere else, and sometimes to encrypt my data when I&#039;m using insecure hotspots, so in all cases the upload-speed of my internet connection is limiting the speed of the vpn-connection and 768kbit/s is slow and this can handle every cpu. A faster cpu or a hardware-crypto wouldn&#039;t change anything. So you just have to figure out if the cpu would be the limiting factor, before you buy something with a faster cpu.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 16 Nov 2011, 15:29)</p>

					<p>it think there is a missunderstanding...</p><p>if you have a synchron 20Mbit/s connection you have to think about the speed of your router! <br />The cpu of the dir-300 cannot handle the encryption of a 20Mbit/s stream so you have to think about a fast cpu, or a hardware-crypto-acceleration. <br />it may be a little different with openvpn, but to get an impression what encryption/decryption-rate the cpus can handle: <br />I just run a scp from my pc to /dev/null of the router so it&#039;s going through an aes-encrypted ssh-connection (no hardware crypto acceleration). <br />I can copy to a asus wl-500g premium (broadcom mips-cpu 250MHz) with a rate of 1MByte/sec so I will not get more than 10Mbit/s if I am using it for a vpn-connection. <br />my wndr3700 (atheros-mips cpu 680Mhz) can handle 3MBytes/s so it will be able to run a vpn-connection up to 30Mbit/s. Your dir-300 (180MHz) will handle 5Mbit/s&nbsp; maybe 6-7Mbits/s but not more. So if you have an faster connection the cpu of the router will probably be a bottleneck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 16 Nov 2011, 16:38)</p>
