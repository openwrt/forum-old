					<p>I just checked the IEEE specs and conformance requires allowing at least one untagged vlan to be configured for tagged ports. Allowing multiples is optional (doesn&#039;t make sense anyway?). So either the ADM is not 802.1q conformant or else the chip is not being setup properly. As I said earlier this works fine on a BCM5335. I don&#039;t have an old unit with the ADM chip to test, but Infineon does claim 802.1q &quot;support&quot; and a quick google didn&#039;t turn up any issues of non-conformance.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>

A cat /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/0/ports resulted in a unexpected behaviour, packets for vlan0 are also tagged after issuing echo &quot;1t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5t &gt; /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/10/ports.

					<p>bitkocher, have you tried this via admcfg rather than new /proc/switch method? If I get a chance I&#039;ll try the new method with the BCM (rather than robocfg) to see if it still works.</p><p>Also, you shouldn&#039;t need the * after 1 (&quot;1*&quot;) although I doubt this is a problem.</p><p>ps: I understand why you put the &quot;1*&quot; as this should be the default vlan for untagged packets received on port 1 so is the &quot;proper&quot; config - it&#039;s just that my working example on the BCM chip doesn&#039;t require this although this may just be sheer luck.</p><p>- DL</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dl</strong> on 4 Apr 2006, 11:16)</p>

The fact that ADM has a config bit setting a port as either tagged or untagged is irrelevant - the spec call for allowing one untagged vlan on a <em>tagged</em> port. The problem in figuring this out is that the datasheet is so poorly written.
