					<p>Hello everyone !</p><p>A friend of mine gave me the above mentioned AP as he managed to brick it somehow and the thing won&#039;t boot anymore. Nevertheless, I want to make this my hobby project and try to get OpenWrt on it.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a USB to Serial adapter: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NooElec-Adapter-Harnesses-Jumper-Compatible/dp/B009GXEF8A/">http://www.amazon.com/NooElec-Adapter-H … 009GXEF8A/</a> and was wondering if someone managed to get something from this device&#039;s bootloader and was willing to share his experience.</p><p>As described here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wa901nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wa901nd</a> there should be a way to do it, but I&#039;m not sure that my tools would be enough.</p><p>I am able to hook up the adapter to my Fedora box just fine:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ 1599.466052] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using xhci_hcd

One thing I noticed is that the AP makes a funny noise while its PWR, SYS and WLAN leds remain on and after 3s, the LAN and QSS leds are flashing while the others are off. This happens in a loop while the little noise can be heard.</p><p>I&#039;d be grateful if anyone could let me know if I still have a chance with it or not.</p><p>Thank you !</p><p><strong>LE: thanks to an the amazing spirit of &#039;community help&#039; of user <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/profile.php?id=43722">nebbia88</a> (thank you again, couldn&#039;t have done it without you !), with his help, I managed to get this nice AP working again.</strong></p><p>Here are the things I used:</p><p>- laptop with FC 19<br />- minicom (picocom can be used as well if you want to do it via tftpboot, see below)<br />- PL2302 USB to TTL (amazon link is above)<br />- obviously, the firmware that you want to use. I used: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin</a> Please rename it to something much shorter like &#039;firm.bin&#039;.<br />- a TFTP server (couldn&#039;t use it in my case, but maybe you&#039;re luckier)<br />- time and steady hands <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So, after you unboxed the adapter, you go ahead and connect the cables to the adapter as follows:</p><p>1. GND - gray<br />2. RX - brown<br />3. TX - blue</p><p>On the AP&#039;s PCB, as you keep it with the antenna plugs oposite from you, from bottom to top:</p><p>1. RX - brown<br />2. TX - blue<br />3. GND - gray</p><p>Obviously, the color choice is all yours; my example is to help you match the pins correctly. Basically, you just need to cross-connect the TX with the RX, (TX - transmit, RX - read), so the adapter can read what the AP says and the other way around. Makes sense, right ? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>This adapter has three LEDs on it. Red ( will be powered on at all time), a tiny yellow/orange one next to the red one, and a blue LED. Yellow/orange and blue will flash synchronously with the AP restarting itself as it&#039;s in a loop (see top of the post).</p><p>Soldering the pins is not necessary if you have great patience and steady hands, but it is the easy and recommended way.</p><p>Once you have the pins connected (see this clip on Youtube on how it should look like: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_mfc6rtNPs),">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_mfc6rtNPs),</a> you can proceed on your computer.</p><p>As this post covers the proces being done on a Linux box, connect the adapter to your USB port and see the <em>dmesg</em> output like in the top of the post.</p><p>Log in as root. Open minicom by doing:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>minicom -s</code></pre></div><p>Go to the &#039;Serial port setup&#039;. Pless &#039;A&#039; key and change to &#039;/dev/ttyUSB0&#039;. Make sure &#039;Bps/Par/Bits&#039; reads &#039;115200 8N1&#039;.<br />Press &#039;ESC&#039; key and then do a &#039;Save settings as dfl&#039;. You&#039;ll find your way pretty easy in this GUI.<br />Press &#039;ESC&#039; once again from the menu to be returned to the terminal itself. You&#039;ll see &#039;Offline&#039; in the bottom-right corner.</p><p>Power on the AP (for the sake of confusion here, please make sure tha your AP IS connected to its power unit) and immediately go back to the minicom terminal and start typing &quot;tpltpltpltpltpltpltpl&quot; (read Tango-Percy-Louise) as fast as you can, multiple times per second even - this was the most fun part <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>Once you get the promp (after you see <em>ar7100&gt;</em>), you can start typing the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ar7100&gt; loady</code></pre></div><p>Now press CTRL+A then Z, and at the menu, choose &#039;Send files&#039; by pressing the &#039;S&#039; key. Choose &#039;ymodem&#039; and just browse to the firmware you want to flash.<br />..wait for the transfer to complete... then proceed with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ar7100&gt; erase 0xbf020000 +0x3c0000
ar7100&gt; cp.b 0x81000000 0xbf020000 0x3c0000
ar7100&gt; reset</code></pre></div><p>Since I was still connected to the box with minicom, after the boot sequence was done, I pressed the &#039;Enter&#039; key and saw the OpenWrt MOTD and resetted the root password from that prompt. You can play around with it from here. Here are my configuration files for a fast setup with the AP getting its IP via DHCP and WiFi enabled:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[dvaida@scat Downloads]$ ssh root@10.0.1.29
