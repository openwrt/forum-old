					<p>you don&#039;t need to specify a specific offset to load an image into memory unless you have a reason to, and you don&#039;t, for flashing, unless you want to take advantage of defaults later on. read the redboot docs people <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

The power supply caps, voltage regs and flash position all look similar, but just a bit different too. Also, the Meraki runs off 7.5 volt. I bet Atheros and accton provided both with design expertise and reference designs.</p><p>EDIT:<br />I had a chat with a guy in Accton some time ago. I was doing some numbers work for a feasibility study and wanted to know rough pricing. He was saying that at the 30,000 unit mark, Accton would take on a significant amount of the design work. He reckoned the $50 mark was about as cheap as those units were going to get. </p><p>I had looked at the chips from <a href="http://www.Axis.se">http://www.Axis.se</a> and am using a board from <a href="http://www.acmesystems.it">http://www.acmesystems.it</a> that works well and supports USB which is essential for me. I wish the Meraki guys would include USB as it would be great for video and music downloads. They could tie in with a video sharing site or company like Joost so that your programs would be downloaded while you are away on a computer that draws only 1 watt. Joost would love it as it would help their P2P download model.</p><br /><p>Cheers</p><p>Diarmuid</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DiarmuidWrenne</strong> on 2 May 2007, 13:07)</p>
