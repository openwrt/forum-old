					<p>Has there been any progress with the HooToo TripMate HT-TM01? I&#039;m looking for a way to use the usb port as a shareport for multiple input devices if that&#039;s even possible.

					<p>Hi all!</p><p>For those interested, I can confirm that the initial image made by wingspinner for HT-TM02 works well with HT-TM01, with the proper modifications in the model version and checksum. I made a modified image based on the HT-TM02 (you can download it from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0ezxmqppj1eww2/openwrt-ramips-rt305x-ht-tm01-squashfs-factory-r42649.bin">here</a>), followed&nbsp; the instructions in the first post of the HT-TM02 thread (I also needed to reboot the unit manually, as it didn&#039;t reboot automatically, and the result was that my HT-TM01 was running OpenWRT. I didn&#039;t try the wifi connection, but Ethernet and Luci worked correctly. The blue system LED didn&#039;t worked after OpenWRT boots up, as wingspinner predicted in the other thread.</p><p>Unfortunately, I performed a sysupgrade in Luci with the latest trunk (I think it was r44441), as I wanted to install some packages, and then I bricked my device, so I couldn&#039;t make further tests... The unit still can be used to charge devices, but when I keep the power button pressed the blue LED keeps on and OpenWRT doesn&#039;t seem to boot. Another user in the HT-TM02 thread is reporting that he also bricked his unit, so I don&#039;t know if this is related to the TM01 or if it is an issue with the latest trunk. I think I&#039;ll have to mess with my USB-serial converter to bring it back. I hope I haven&#039;t deleted the bootloader...</p><p>So, for those who want to flash OpenWRT in their HT-TM01, you can try wingspinnner initial image, but be careful with the latest trunk!</p><p>Regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to recover my HT-TM01 through console (something should be wrong in the sysupgrade process, as it was reporting a kernel panic on boot). I flashed the latest HT-TM02 trunk image (r44462) and right know is working without problems. Even the power LED is working (flashes in green on boot and turns to blue when the WiFi interface goes up).</p><p>I&#039;ve configured it as mobile hotspot with a USB 3G modem and it&#039;s working nice. The next step will be configuring OpenVPN and VPNC, so I&#039;ll have a portable VPN hotspot for work and home. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks to wingspinner and all the people that contribute to make OpenWRT so amazing!</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
