					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m currently running dd-wrt on a wndr3300 and I want openwrt because I can make the router one of those virtual softphone things (sip gate??... still learning!) so I can make calls via voip without buying a secondary adapter or anything of the like for an analog phone.</p><p>my question is, after looking at the list of supported routers and not seeing the wndr3300 there, is it officially not possible for me to put openwrt on it? and if it is possible, where should i look to get guidance for it?</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>also i have a spare dlink di-624, so if its easier to install on this router (and run it at the same time as my wndr3300), i&#039;m all ears. obviously, i would disable wireless on the di624 if possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Asterisk? Fine. It&#039;s a software VoIP server and not a hardware telephone adapter. How do you talk to others without a mic and an earphone? Maybe you just have a spare telephone. Where do you want to connect it to? WNDR3300? Get real or get a Cisco Linksys SPA1001. Do your lessons, start playing VoIP and stop daydreaming.</p>									</div>

					<p>At least you need a sound card to <em><strong>talk</strong></em> to the router. Unfortunately Netgear WNDR3300 doesn&#039;t equip with usb port to support usb sound card. If you really don&#039;t want to buy an adapter or VoIP gateway, you&#039;ll need a router like&nbsp; <a href="http://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/wireless/lbc/WRT54GP2A-AT">Linksys WRT54GP2A-AT</a> or D-Link DVG-G1402S.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, your point is well taken.&nbsp; One would not be able to use the WNDR3300 to make VOIP calls with Asterisk (or other PBX/VOIP server) without using a secondary adapter for use with an analog phone (i.e. an ATA).&nbsp; However, any PC on the network could utilize the server to make VOIP calls with a softphone application... or you could just use a SIP phone.</p>									</div>
