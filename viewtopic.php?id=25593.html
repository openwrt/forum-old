					<p>Can somebody verify this on another tl-wr741nd?</p><p>I just got a tl-wr741nd and flashed backfire 10.03. Everything works fine but the external antenna is not being used. I&#039;m using mac80211/ath9k</p><p>This router has only one external antenna but internally it has two, one of them as a PCB trace antenna. I have tried putting a reflector on the external antenna, using a 14db panel antenna and I see no change in reception (always the same amount of aps when scanning, same power, etc). I also expected it to be much better with the stock antenna.</p><p>So, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion it&#039;s NOT using the external antenna but the internal pcb one. Maybe diversity is disabled but the antenna is not set correctly or something. txantenna, rxantenna and diversity seem to be all ignored in /etc/config/wireless.</p><p>You can see the antenna connections on this pic from the wiki:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-link/wr741nd-09-serial-pins.jpg">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/toh/tp-l … l-pins.jpg</a></p><p>i opened a ticket too: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7576">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7576</a></p><p>some <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ath9k-devel@lists.ath9k.org/msg02330.html">info about the ar9285</a> wireless nic from Luis Rodriguez (from atheros):<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&gt; AR5416 and AR9280 are 2 stream.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; <strong>AR9285 is 1 stream.</strong><br />&gt;<br />&gt; All AR9280s are 2 stream and have a 2x2 RX/TX chain configuration.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The AR5416 has an 3x2 RX/TX chain configuration but it must be noted<br />&gt; this then means one stream can use two chains with selection diversity<br />&gt; -- sort of like antenna diversity but for one chain.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; <strong>AR9285 devices are 1-stream and use antenna diversity with some<br />&gt; enhancements</strong>, I think one of the enhancements is LNA, which I believe<br />&gt; means we get to dynamically configure the power amplifier depending on<br />&gt; the noise on the driver and I think this helps with noisy<br />&gt; environments.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; AR9170 is 2 stream 2x2 chain config.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; AR9271 (USB) is 1 stream with antenna diversity support (and LNA IIRC).<br />&gt;<br />&gt;&nbsp; Luis<br />&gt;</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/50782">more:</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>802.11n does allow for 1 stream devices with a 1x1 TX/RX chain setup<br /><strong>but the hardware *can* have two antennas</strong> like your typical legacy<br />device with diversity enabled. <strong>This is the case for AR9285</strong>, for<br />example.</p><p> Luis</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naplam</strong> on 7 Jul 2010, 15:47)</p>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I have been fiddling with the TL-WR741ND&nbsp; and noticed this problem too.&nbsp; I decided to do some testing by disabling the internal pcb trace antenna (by removing a 0 ohm link) and soldered on another rpsma socket.<br />This way I could attach two antenna&#039;s , one to the original rpsma socket and another to the newly added socket.</p><p>I then attached an antenna to the new socket , did a scan for nearby AP&#039;s.&nbsp; All the Ap&#039;s I know to be around this area were detected.&nbsp; Apon removing the antenna, i then rescanned. This time it found far fewer AP&#039;s.</p><p>The oposite was then tried with an antenna attached ONLY to the original socket. A laptop running netstumbler was used to monitor the output from the AP, the antenna then removed resulting in a sharp drop in the netsumbler signal plots.</p><p>I did both of these tests several times. It seems to confirm that the internal trace antenna is used for RX and the antenna attached externally is for TX.</p><p>Sorry for the long winded waffle <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I am not the best at explanations.</p><br /><p>Hoping this info is of use, </p><p>Brad</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again,</p><p>I forgot to mention that the firmware used was TP-link&#039;s and NOT Openwrt (I have yet to be able to get the wireless working at all when openwrt is installed, sorry thats probably best in another thread <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>This seems to indicate that the antenna problem is not with Openwrt code but maybe underlying source code from the manufacturer of the Wifi IC?&nbsp; </p><p>...

					<p>ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (bleeding edge, r26290) uses Linux Kernel 2.6.37. Yeah, its bleeding edge and not stable, but well, it does work quite nicely.</p><p>And no, as long as there are not binary patches, you cannot use the firmware generator to accomplish this. You won&#039;t need to compile the toolchain, but crosscompile the source after applieying patch with a precompiled toolchain (aka SDK). Or try bleeding edge ;-)</p>									</div>
