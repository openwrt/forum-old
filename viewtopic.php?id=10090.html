					<p>If you google for this error message - you will see other posts (either this forum or elsewhere on the Internet) which document some problems using the PL2303 with linux 2.4.x.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Apparently driver problems have been fixed in&nbsp; linux 2.6.x.&nbsp; <br />If Kamikaze 2.6 works for you (no wilreless on WL 500G P) then you can upgrade to Kamikaze. </p><p>See ticket # 779 at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/779">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/779</a> for the history here. </p><p>Otherwise I remember seeing a post about someone backporting the 2.6.x PL2303 driver back to 2.4.x and I think that worked. So you can try to google for that. </p><p>I personally did not need RTS/DTR lines so I could live with the buggy PL2303 driver. </p><p>You may want to try FTDI based converters. I have one which did not give any error msgs but I don&#039;t know about RTS/DTR. </p><p>They should cost less than US$20</p>									</div>

					<p>Problem is that I need wireless, so I cannot use 2.6.x. (WL500gx). Also the ticket referenced above mentions that FTDI converters gives the same error?<br />So my only rescuse at the moment is a backported 2.6.x driver, but the only one I could find would not load in openwrt. (Made for unslung).<br />If anyone is aware of a backported 2.6.x to 2.4.x pl2303 (pl2303X) driver that works please let me&nbsp; know.</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have found the backported driver source - just recompile it using Buildroot-ng. It is a fair amount of work but if you are intending to develop apps&nbsp; with openwrt you will probably have to get over that hump that at some time. </p><p>Alternatively you can see if others have had issues with keyspan or belkin converters, and if all looks good go with those. </p><p>I do agree the lack of wireless support in 2.6.x for the Broadcom wireless card is a real pain for users of the Asus wl500g. It&#039;s a really neat box otherwise.&nbsp; Hopefully the&nbsp; openwrt gurus will address that at soon.</p>									</div>

					<p>Problem is solved. I created a Kamikaze build environment on my Ubuntu system, and did a build of kamikaze 2.4.34. I then copied usbserial.o and pl2303.o from the created build to my 2.4.30 openwrt (after renaming the old modules), did an insmod of the new modules, and comms to my WS2300 weather station was finally working ok.<br />If anyone else needs the compiled modules drop me a note. </p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>Great. <br />Did you use the backported 2.6.x driver for pl2303.c&nbsp; and usbserial.c ?<br />Or is this a linux 2.4.34 version driver ? <br />If it is a 2.4.34 driver - could you do a diff on the 2.4.34 and 2.4.30 versions and post the difference. <br />And is there a website that you can put the compiled modules on ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes to both of your questions. The kamikaze linux 2.4.34 driver is a backported 2.6.x driver. I do not have the 2.4.30 source readily available, so I cannot do a diff.

					<p>I haven&#039;t used the weatherstation. <br />In the past, I used PL203 and FTDI based USB to serial converters for some other projects where I was controlling boards with serial ports.&nbsp; The PL2303 converters are available from newegg and many other sites. <br />For FTDI&nbsp; based converters, you can go to FTDI&#039;s website&nbsp; or you can google for that. </p><p>Again I am not sure if the problem you are having will go away with FTDI or not.&nbsp; So best to buy a cable from a store which will allow you to return it. </p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Earlier I used same Prolific based USb to serial adapter cable, got almost same error. Then I got a <a href="http://www.usconverters.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=67">USB to Serial adapter</a> with a FTDI based chipset, which supposely should be better than the Prolific chipset; and believe it or not, it worked right away!</p>									</div>
