					<p>I chanced upon this site when searching about 3G and OpenWRT<br /><a href="http://www.rfactory.org/OpenWRT/">http://www.rfactory.org/OpenWRT/</a><br />This custom firmware is using OpenWRT but when I looked at the packages to get 3G support it has a lot more packages installed then the 3G requirements in OpenWRT.<br />I would like to know <br />Which modules are optional which are required?<br />What is the difference between ROOTer&#039;s 3G support and OpenWRT 3g support as described by the wiki.<br />The changes they made looked pretty cool hopes it gets committed to OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>Essentially the ROOter firmware is an attempt to bypass the 25Mbps limit of traditional ppp connections for 4G LTE modems, which are capable of much higher speeds, up to 150Mbps for cat 4 usb modems.</p><p>The ROOter has scripts which recognise the modem type when inserted and use the appropriate driver for the LTE connection. This so far includes Sierra modems, QMI, cdc-ncm, phones, and some of the newer wifi/hotspot/modem devices, and probably some others I have forgotten. All without using ppp, and getting native 4G LTE speeds.</p><p>The QMI connection is all controlled via a lua script that does not need the &gt; 1MB libqmi files, hence the whole system can fit in a 4MB flash router like an MR3420.</p><p>Other very useful functionality includes being able to see your signal stats in the web interface, sending AT commands to the&nbsp; modem from the web interface and bandwidth monitoring. Much more info can be found at <a href="http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/router_openwrt">http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/router_openwrt</a><br />and firmware can be downloaded from here <a href="http://www.rfactory.org/OpenWRT/index.html">http://www.rfactory.org/OpenWRT/index.html</a></p><p>All of these modifications are contained in the scripts, which can be added to your build env in the /files dir. These scripts are also available on the above site.</p>									</div>

					<p>@coltect: thank you for the info. Keeping system size down is an advantage irrespective of router flash size, as that allows for other stuff. </p><p>And you can tell <a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2082289&amp;p=88#r1745">The Cobia </a> we are not poo pooing just exploring&nbsp; :-)</p><p><a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2082289&amp;p=88#r1748">And so</a> now I know clearly that ROOter and OpenWRT represent 2 different approaches to 4G/LTE connectivity.</p>									</div>
