					<p>Hello,</p><p>I need some help to implement qos <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> In fact I am a newbie about QoS.<br />I have a LTE Internet connection which is very unstable, sometimes I only reach 15Mbits... I tried to use SQM but the connection speed is changing a lot, so if i set the value to 15Mbits I will never reach 30Mbits again. Thats not my prefered solution.</p><p>But I need your help to slow down windows updates. I want to slow down them by using QoS. Any ideas? They are using the whole bandwith and I can&#039;t even browse in the Internet because of bufferbloat. SQM is not a solution because sometimes I reach 40Mbits, but in the evening only about 15 Mbits...</p><p>Thx in advance!</p><p>so long</p>									</div>

You should be able to look inside the old openwrt configuration files for reference. I typically first make a copy of the whole /overlay directory from the old router to my laptop, before starting the update, that way I can a) look at my old settings and b) if unhappy with the new version all I need to do is re-flash the old firmware and simply copy the contents of the saved /overlay (drive into the overlay directory and copy the contined directories like ./etc onto the /etc directory of the re-installed old firmware...).</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>
