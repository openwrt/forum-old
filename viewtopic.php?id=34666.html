					<p>Your mileage may vary, but I have only been successful in using the TFTP process for installing firmware on the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH that I have.&nbsp; I used the process documented at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h#oem.installation.using.the.tftp.method">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr … ftp.method</a> with one minor exception.&nbsp; I had to put a static arp entry in for the MAC address recorded on my device rather than the &quot;02:aa:bb:cc:dd:20&quot; mentioned in the instructions.&nbsp; On all other counts, the document worked perfectly.</p><p>The fortunate thing I have found with this hardware is that it does not appear to be easy to &quot;brick&quot; even when there are faulty firmware images loaded into it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I too just go with the TFTP process with my G300NH. It&#039;s also easiest to do it from Linux (use a LiveCD for ex). Doing it from Windows is usually quite frustrating because the TFTP transfer just doesn&#039;t want to happen. I can usually get the transfer to work on the first or second try with Linux.</p><p>You can&#039;t brick these routers AFAIK.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swaaye</strong> on 12 Feb 2012, 00:59)</p>

					<p>I haven&#039;t looked at Gargoyle. AFAIK, OpenWRT Backfire (10.03) was the first to support G300NH.&nbsp; And, early Backfire builds had a lot of wireless problems with it because the ATH9K driver was poor back then and Linux wireless is ever improving in general.</p><p>I&#039;m running a customized OpenWRT trunk build right now. 10.03.1 is good as well.&nbsp; The LUCI GUI may not be super refined but I think it gets the job done.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swaaye</strong> on 12 Feb 2012, 19:54)</p>

					<p>The main two reasons I want Gargoyle over any of the other WRT&#039;s is for the Whitelist functionality and for familiarity. I have been running Gargoyle for several years on an older router and I was hoping to upgrade to this router. The main sticking point seems to be the switch. Backfire supports the rtl8366s but the version of the router I have has the rtl8366rb. That switch is supported by OpenWRT trunk.</p><p>I&#039;m looking into what I need to do to compile Gargoyle with rtl8366rb support. Should be fun. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Greydesk</p>									</div>
