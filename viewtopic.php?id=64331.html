I&#039;m getting 500 pings on game servers while torrents are running.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sqm aims to require less manual intervention/configuration at the router than qos-scripts, this comes at the small cost of not offering too much knobs to tweak things; unfortunatelly torrents atre currently not handled too well by default sqm-scripts. If you manage to set dscp marks on the torrenting computers (like CS1 for background traffic like torrents) simple.qos and layer_cake.qos will try to move them into the background queue, which should at least ameliorate your problem, BUT as far as I know no bittorrent client offers easy ways to set the dscp/tos marks and also this wil only ever work reasonably well for egress, if your contention hppens on ingress that is not going to help too much.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That said, hnyman&#039;s builds for the wndr3800 (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t52c02rm20y8x9p/khFGAJu3gc , see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a> ) offer more recent cake that will accept the keyword &quot;triple-isolate&quot; as advanced option strings under the &#039;Queue DIscipline&quot; tab if you check both of the &quot;Show and use advanced options&quot; and &quot;Show and use&nbsp; dangerous options&quot; checkboxes. With this set for ingress and egress cake should be a bit nicer to your gaming traffic. I say should as this option really awaits thorough testing by people that actually use bit torrent, so I very much would appreciate your help and support <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Ivoz wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Settings I have -<br />Interface: pppoe-wan<br />Download: 5000<br />Upload: 500</p><p>Disciplines: I have tried both fq_codel / simple, and cake / layer_cake so far.</p><p>Link Layer Adaption: I have it set to ATM &amp; 44. I&#039;m not sure if this is correct or not, given my connection is over PPPoE.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May I recommend to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/moeller0/ATM_overhead_detector">https://github.com/moeller0/ATM_overhead_detector</a> This should help you in empirically figure out what exact per packet overhead your line uses.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Ivoz wrote:</cite><blockquote><br /><p>I could try and re-install QoS-scripts again, but SQM is supposed to be newer and better... however I cannot figure out how to set it up, if it indeed can do the same job.

In your case that does not seem to work too well, so sticking to qos-scripts or even gargoyle might be easiest. (That said I would still appreciate if you could squeeze in a test with layer_cake.qos and the &quot;triple-isolate&quot; keyword to see whether this makes a least a dent into the unfairness issue you see between gaming and torrent traffic)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
