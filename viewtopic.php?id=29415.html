					<p>AFAIK, you should never upgrade firmware this way... Instead, you should download new firmware image file and use `sysupgrade` command-line utility (or upgrade through luci web interface if you prefer GUI).</p><p>For now you probably can restore you router following these steps:<br />1. Unplug power cable;<br />2. Hold &quot;reset&quot; button at the back side of the device;<br />3. Plug power cable holding &quot;reset&quot;;<br />4. Wait until status LED begins slowly blinking orange and release &quot;reset&quot; button;<br />5. Open <a href="http://192.168.0.1">http://192.168.0.1</a> or <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> address with Internet Explorer.<br />There you&#039;ll see original D-Link firmware recovery tool prompt. You will be able to load either original D-Link firmware or OpenWrt factory firmware images using this page. All previous settings will be lost, indeed.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks man.</p><p>also, took me a while until i accepted it would only work in IE... will try to document the bogus js/capture packages next time i have to do it just so we can update our routers in the future, when there&#039;s no IE to be found <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>In fact, once I&#039;ve managed to successfully restore firmware through this page using Opera 11.01.<br />But others say it doesn&#039;t work on Opera either. Don&#039;t know what&#039;s the difference. Anyway, with IE it always works ok.</p>									</div>
