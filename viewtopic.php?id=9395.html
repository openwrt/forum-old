					<p>So if the 802.11a and 802.11g dual bands can be separated, we could have WDS with the two routers talking 802.11a to each other and with the AP still be able to deliver full 802.11g to the client instead of half bandwidth, right?&nbsp; That would be very useful, considering this is the HP model with the internal amplifier, ideal for WDS setups.</p>									</div>

					<p>Basic support for the Buffalo WHR-HP-AG108 works. You have to change HAL from ap51 to ap30 in package/madwifi/Makefile, then wifi works as well.<br/>One thing that&#039;s still untested is booting from flash, but theoretically that should work as well.</p>									</div>
