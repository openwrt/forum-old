					<p>MD3200 chipsets modems also known to work wit asterisk, but not anything else (no cheap solution)</p><p>One important point when you use an Intel V92 modem card that has not been purchased as the X100P card from Digium, but otherwise look identical to it, is that the electronic vendorID read from the card will be different. There are two ways to get around this: </p><p>1. If you are compiling Asterisk from source, edit the zaptel/wcfxo.c file as follows: </p><p>Existing code: <br />static struct pci_device_id wcfxo_pci_tbl[] __devinitdata = { <br />{ 0xe159, 0x0001, 0x8085, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, (unsigned long) &amp;wcx101p }, <br />{ 0x1057, 0x5608, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, (unsigned long) &amp;wcx100$ }; </p><p>Now change the wcfxo_pci_tbl[] in zaptel/wsfxo.c to: <br />static struct pci_device_id wcfxo_pci_tbl[] __devinitdata = { <br />{ 0xe159, 0x0001, 0x8085, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, (unsigned long) &amp;wcx101p }, <br />{ 0xe159, 0x0001, 0x8086, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, (unsigned long) &amp;wcx101p }, <br />{ 0x1057, 0x5608, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, (unsigned long) &amp;wcx100$ }; </p><p>The added line in the middle will allow the wcfxo driver to work with off the shelf Intel v92 Winmodem cards as well as with the Digium X100P cards. </p><br /><p>2. The other alternative is to make the same modification to the card that Digium did when they turned them into &quot;genuine&quot; X100P cards. Simply carefully remove R13 and R19 with a soldering iron. R13 &amp; R19 are pull down resistors that affects the vendorID number that is read from the card. With these two resistors gone, you now have a card that will appear as a genuine Digium X100P card to the Asterisk software. </p><p>Cards purchased from vendors such as DigitNetworks will already have been modified this way, but then they charge quite a bit more than the US $5 - $15 that one can pick up these Intel Winmodem PCI cards for elsewhere. It is considerably cheaper when you modify the wcfxo driver source code, and/or remove the 2 resistors yourself.</p><p>credits to velvetfog</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wirelessjoe</strong> on 1 Jun 2005, 19:04)</p>

					<p>Well, the source code is available but I think, there is still a lot of work to do to get it work out of the box by an openwrt firmware. If anyone has got a WRTP54G, it would be great for him to being submitted firmware and test whether it works or not <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

(yeah, go configure, he accuses me installing 3rd party firmware (that had yet to exist) despite my providing him the link to the vonage/linksys release of the firmware ... without ever having an inkling that if I had accomplished what he had accused me of, i certainly wouldn&#039;t be on the phone listening to him rant about how vonage didn&#039;t support ssh or a shell on this router.&nbsp; </p><p>What i realized was that retail service resellers like vonage would never have anyone even remotely resembling a real engineer since they are merely resellers of the technology.&nbsp; As a result, the technology must be necessarily dictated to them (in this case by linksys), which they must try to digest and repackage to sell&nbsp; ... also meaning that any attempt to close or protect firmware images could not possibly have originated on their side.&nbsp; Linksys would be loathe of themselves to make it harder to access to custom firmware they are specifically packaging&nbsp; for vonage customers, since vonage chief scientists so thoroughly lack any understanding of the technology to begin with.&nbsp; Explaining lzma compression to the most senior vonage engineer could be the proverbial ice floe that wrecks havoc upon&nbsp; the titanic sized linksys trans-continental pan-indian support contingency and take their highly coveted strategic partnership off the table .... which i&#039;m sure is not what they want.</p><br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Y</p>									</div>

With that not seeming possible on this unit (the PSPBoot version on this unit is 1.3.3.11 as opposed to the 1.2.22.17 on wag354 listing, perhaps explaining the difference?) the control c&nbsp; action that kicks you into the login prompt actually disables the tftp server it seems:</p><p>Waiting for enter to start &#039;/bin/login&#039; (pid 34, terminal /dev/tts/0)</p><p>Please press Enter to activate this console.<br />Starting pid 34, console /dev/tts/0: &#039;/bin/login&#039;</p><p><strong>BusyBox on (none) login: Sep&nbsp; 8 12:00:03 cm_pc: tftpu service disabled.</strong></p><p>Sep&nbsp; 8 12:00:03 cm_monitor: Monitor Starting<br />SYSTEM_POWER_ON<br />SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device<br />SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device<br />SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device<br />resolver: configuration tree:<br />Sep&nbsp; 8 12:00:05 Sep&nbsp; 8 12:00:05 [001310A34628] cfgmgr(ap): AP Acquiring Lock<br />Sep&nbsp; 8 12:00:05 [001310A34628] cfgmgr(provision): Converting VOICE_XML2 to VOICE_XML<br />[001310A34628] cfgmgr(ap): AP Acquiring Lock<br />Sep&nbsp; 8 12:00:05 [001310A34628] cfgmgr(provision): Converting VOICE_XML2 to VOICE_XML</p><br /><p>So i see the options at this point being:</p><p>1. keep plugging away at trying to tftp my own image into that nano sized window<br />2. jtag nirvana</p><p>I&#039;m going to try building a jtag cable for it and see if i can get at the firmware that way.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Ydef</strong> on 24 Aug 2005, 16:44)</p>
