					<p>Have you tested your serial converter by just connecting its Tx and Rx wires together and typing something in putty? Do you see the echo of what you are typing?<br />If that worked, have you tried to swap Tx and Rx when connecting to the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>No, I mean that you should only connect your converters Tx to your converters Rx. No connection to the router. This way you can test, if your converter works properly. Whatever you type in putty should appear instantly (check local echo settings of putty, if available - I never used it).</p>									</div>

As of 2013 the simplest way to convert USB to low-voltage UART is to use appropriate chip like FT232, CP201...2103 and somesuch. And of course there are ready solutions based on these ICs selling around. Starting from &quot;old&quot; mobile phone cables&nbsp; (which convert USB to low-voltage UART excatly like that one you need) up to embedded developer tools (those guys are often use those UARTs for debug). In fact USB to UART converters are quite common and inexpensive these days. You can read openwrt wiki to get some ideas on this. </p><p>If I got it right. you are about to convert USB to RS232 first (RS232 is *not* level compatible with 3.3V UART!) and then ... downconvert it to 3.3V UART using MAX232? </p><p>Usually &quot;USB to RS232&quot; converter is in fact some USB to UART bridge IC like FT232, CP2101 or similar, which converts USB to low-voltage UART (like that one you actually need) and then another IC shifts levels to RS232 using IC like MAX232 to reach RS232 compatibility (i.e. bipolar 12V levels, you don&#039;t need or want them!). Then you put yet another MAX232 to ... downshift levels back to 3.3V UART? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Well, you see, it&#039;s a bit silly: two extra MAX232-like ICs on the way and RS232 physical level used which you don&#039;t need or want anyway. OTOH it makes things more complicated, could make signal worse and harder to troubleshoot as there are more connections involved. Though theoretically it could work and isn&#039;t anyhow invalid on it&#039;s own. Just somewhat suboptimal. </p><p>And hopefully you&#039;ve never attached RS232 (bi-polar, 12V) levels to 3.3V UART. Doing so is likely to fry router CPU. Pay extra attention to this. As for me it&#039;s not a great idea to have RS232 bipolar 12V levels around when dealing with 3.3V ICs. Basically it&#039;s wrong to attach digital I/O pins to anything above IC supply (i.e. 3.3V) or below GNS (0V). Doing so is likely to fry IC. That&#039;s why modern ICs need MAX232-like level shifter to operate with ancient bipolar RS232 levels. </p><p>Then, guy suggested that<br />1) Grab your converter. <br />2) Connect converter&#039;s TX pin to converter&#039;s RX pin. There should be no other devices attached to UART (i.e. don&#039;t connect bricked device, etc). <br />3) Start some terminal and connect to that COM port.<br />4) Set up port to use no flow control. And make sure local echo is off. <br />5) Type something. <br />5) Check if you can see what you type.</p><p>If everything is done correctly and your converter actually works, you will see same text as you typed because it&#039;s transmitted via TX line and then immediately received via RX like on the same port (that&#039;s why guy asked to connect them). Note that terminal could do local echo - make sure it&#039;s off. This test allows to understand if your converter actually works and is able to transmit data and receive it back.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier since no external devices involved, only converter itself should work for this test. If you can&#039;t get past this point, there is something wrong with your converter, OS drivers, port settings or something else, not anyhow related to bricked device(s) or something like that.</p>									</div>
