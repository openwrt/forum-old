					<p>I want to build a rtlwifi kernel module &amp; thought the right thing to do would be to make a package. So I tried to follow the kernel package FAQ. It showed up in the make menuconfig, but the module wasn&#039;t being built. </p><p>After a while I noticed that these kernel modules are being overridden by the mac80211 package . I my&nbsp; package stanza to the mac80211 Makefile. This tried to build, but gave errors that the .ko file wasn&#039;t found. </p><p>That&#039;s when I worked out that the kernel files aren&#039;t being used at all for that driver, and it&#039;s actually built in compat wireless. When compat-wireless builds, it looks like the makefile is being overridden by some build options pulled from ? When I try to build compat-wireless using the toolchain, it won&#039;t let me build that driver. </p><p>1) What is the right way to build this driver?<br />2) How can I get rid of compat-wireless and just use the kernel? What will that break? <br />3) has anyone else successfully got rtl8192cus working?</p>									</div>

					<p>Still no clue how to make the package building work for mac81211 modules in the correct openwrt way.&nbsp; Is it a problem with the install stanza? </p><p> What follows is a kludge, but there are&nbsp; are a lot of rtl8192cu related posts that end&nbsp; with a request &amp; nobody responding. Here&#039;s at least something that worked once. </p><p>There&#039;s a patch below that will force compat-wireless to build the module. It won&#039;t build a package though, so you have to manually copy the rtlwifi.ko rtl8192c-common.ko and rtl8192cu.ko to /lib/modules on the openwrt.

					<p>Hello MichaelTyson, I have been trying exactly thatm thanks for the nice patch.</p><p>The only issue is that for a VERY&nbsp; mysterious reason, it does not work. More precisely, when I add the following lines:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>+&nbsp; &nbsp; FILES:=$(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/rtlwifi.ko \<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/rtl8192c/rtl8192c-common.ko \<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/rtl8192cu/rtl8192cu.ko</p></blockquote></div><p>(or when I add a single file, say, rtlwifi.ko alone for instance), the command &quot;make package/mac80211/compile V=99&quot; fails with the following error: (and of course so does &quot;make&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )</p><p><strong>Makefile:1614: *** missing separator.&nbsp; Stop.</strong></p><p>The line 1614 is the one where we have your patched line :</p><p><strong>$(eval $(call KernelPackage,rtl8192cu))</strong></p><p>The issue comes from inside the KernelPackage/rtl8192cu function. I tried a lot of things, paid a close attention to my tabs/spaces, used the code from other working drivers, well, as soon as I put a &quot;FILES:=&quot; directive in the rtl8192cu section, it&#039;s over.</p><p>Did I miss something really stupid ? I&#039;m supposed to know quite a little about Makefiles, but there, I really don&#039;t get what&#039;s the matter. If you think you have a hint that could help me, of if you can reproduce the issue... </p><p>Thanks a lot for the patch anyway !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vperron</strong> on 30 Oct 2012, 19:25)</p>

					<p>Hi vperron,</p><p>I can confirm the results.<br />Patch was merged successfully (though there was a few rejections that I had to add manually, probably something I did wrong to begin with).</p><p>To be honest, I have very limited knowledge with linux and actually compiled my first build of openwrt today.<br />I&#039;ve read through the build package wiki and compared the makefiles to others in the system for syntax problems. Couldnt find any(I code on windows, so its not completely alien).</p><p>I&#039;m also getting the same errors on the $(eval $(call KernelPackage call when trying to compile the make file posted here(lat line of makefile): <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39677">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39677</a><br />My ended state is to get an ALFA AWUS036NHR working on a Tplink WR703N (ar71xx).<br />MichaelTyson, your post gives me hope that I might actually get this going, thanks for posting your makefile.</p><p>Any suggestions on why we are getting this error? I&#039;m sure its something stupid on my end, but a hint in the right direction would be wonderful. I noticed on the other thread that the line &quot; TITLE=Realtek 8192C USB WiFi&quot; is missing the : in front of the =, not sure how important it is. I&#039;m not posting on the other thread as I suspect the problem is probably on my end, just dont know where.</p><p>If it makes a difference, I am using the guide posted on thepowerbase.com and the svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ repository. Build system is ubuntu 12.04 32bit running through vmware and was able to compile a valid image that I tested so I think the build system is good.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I was able to get past the error on the other make file I mentioned before that was getting the exact same error.<br />Basically the make file structure/syntax is extremely picky and errored out because of spaces instead of tabs.<br />I removed all the indents that were made up of spaces and replaced them with tabs and it compiled. I&#039;m having other problems but its not related to this.<br />If I get a chance I&#039;ll try this patch again and let you know my results.</p><p>Also in the article that suggested the syntax, they mentioned that some text editors automatically change tabs to spaced indents on save, so verify later that they are still tabs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I finally had a chance to test it out and it works.<br />Like I mentioned in my previous posts its a formatting issue.<br />The MakeFiles are extremely picky.</p><p>Using MichaelTyson posted script I did the following:</p><p>save the patch and ran it against package/mac80211/Makefile (cd trunk; patch &lt; Makefile.patch) like he stated.<br />Then I went through the new Makefile and I changed the indentation on each line that was modified to what appeared correct looking at the rest of the files format (I&#039;m still learning so I am not 100% sure if 2 spaces or a tab is more appropriate, but both seemed to work). I did it based on the code listed directly beside, some had spaces others had tabs.<br />On some lines there was about 5 spaces, which is problably what was stopping it.</p><p>The only other problem I had and it could have been with my setup and not the script is that rtl8192c*fw.bin does get compiled but its saved in /lib/firmware/ , rtlwifi is looking for it in /lib/firmware/rtlwifi/ so I just created the rtlwifi directory and cp it over.</p><p>Works like a charm and was able to get my adapter recognized and loaded. All features seeemed to work through LuCI even scanning which was mentioned not to work. Till I changed my device&#039;s IP address and for some weird fluke scanning stopped and it became very erradic like stated in the other topic started by MichaelTyson that I linked to.</p>									</div>

					<p>@axishero: I get errors with your patch. I&#039;m using OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment (r33369) from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/raspberrypi-openwrt/">http://code.google.com/p/raspberrypi-openwrt/</a> and I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing wrong. <br />Is there any other source for the rt8191 package meanwhile?</p>									</div>
