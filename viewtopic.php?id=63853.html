					<p>This my first attempt on compiling openWRT from sources&nbsp; so I decided to start by compiling an image for the super cheap (and powerful) router (A5-V11) that can be found on AliExpress for about $7.<br />The A5-V11 has very limited storage (4MB) that is not enough to get full advantage of the router (USB 2.0 Port, Wifi and Ethernet port) like installing the USB-related cool stuff like samba file sharing , USB-to-Serial drivers , file system ..etc <br />So I begun with de-soldered the spi flash and and saved it&#039;s contents as binary file (using usb spi progammer ) </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/i87W8vG.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/i87W8vG.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dmCE3qh.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/dmCE3qh.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p>and programmed the file contents to the new 8M spi flash (W25Q64BV) to get a working image (openWRT still reads it as 4M) and Edited the /target/linux/ramips/dts/A5-V11.dts file to:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/dts-v1/;
