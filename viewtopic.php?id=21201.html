					<p>I think some people are missing the point here. There are several ways to access the IPv6 internet via tunneled connections.</p><p>What OpenWRT has in abundance is support for tunnelbrokers. There are plenty of scripts floating around this forum and there are packages like 6scripts and aiccu that will take care of getting you connected via sixxs.net or HE/tunnelbroker.net.</p><p>However, using a tunnelbroker always requires extra work on the part of the user: One has to sign up for these services and make sure the configuration is correct etc. etc. etc.</p><p>The confusion happening here is probably on what the terms 6to4 refers to. 6in4 describes a way to embed IPv4-Adresses into IPv6-Adresses, 6to4 is a specification for a layer 3 tunneling of IPv6-packets through an IPv4-network. Some tunnelbrokers offer using 6to4 for tunneling to their access points.</p><p>The real cool thing however is using 6in4 with anycast. Several people around the internet are hosting 6to4-gateways, reachable via an Anycast-IPv4-Address. To use this service one only needs to configure the local router - no signup is neccessary. There isn&#039;t even an actual tunnel built.</p><p>The local router will find the gateway via the anycast-Address. The gateway will find its way back to the local router from the IPv6-address the router uses: it contains an embedded representation of the IPv4-Address (so if you have a dynamic IPv4 address, you also have a dynamic IPv6 address). This representation also specifies that every (routeable) IPv4-Address is assigned a /48-IPv6-Prefix.</p><p>There are numerous advantages and disadvantages to using a tunnelbroker or 6to4-Anycast. The first will give you a static IPv6-network, while the latter gives you some anonymity (no RIPE handle needed etc.). The first requires signup, the latter only requires being enabled in the configuration (example: in Debian you have to copy/paste five configuration lines and you&#039;re on IPv6).</p><p>What OpenWRT still lacks is support for 6to4-anycast. It&#039;s no use if you want to access your computers at home via IPv6, but it will probably be enough to enable 90% of OpenWRT users to happily access the IPv6 internet.</p><p>So basically what I&#039;m saying is that scripts written for tunnelbrokers are not going to help much :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I can tell, you don&#039;t really need to set the prefix for radvd, just change the ignore to 0 in the stock config and it should work (but needs restart if the IP changes).<br />Also, I think you have to set an IP on the lan interface? 6tunnel does not seem to do this...</p>									</div>

					<p>6in4 is no better. It autodetects the local IPv4, but it does not autodetect the IPv6 prefix.

					<p>True enough. I&#039;m just trying to show that this is not a solved problem, which many people seem to believe. To top it off it should be done as a hotplug on the dhcp interface, so that it&#039;ll be update if the ip changes.</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed it manually and it seems to work great. Many thanks. Only issue is that the radvd changes shows up as luci changes, but I can live with that.</p><p>Edit: Actually, the radvd configuration is not needed, the default one works fine if you just set ignore to 0 (which is probably best done manually).
