					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>first post <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I have played with openwrt before without any major-unsolvable problems but this time I am stuck!</p><p>I have the same problem with the identical serial data with the post #1<br />&gt;&gt; Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)<br />Hardware version is 2.4.</p><p>Im connected (192.168.1.5/24) through a switch to have the ports active asap.<br />The router is never pingable. I even tried tftp (just in case) and it cannot connect. Im using ubuntu so I shouldnt care that much about timing. I start the put command before powering up the router.</p><p>Im not sure if the LEDs mean anything but just to describe everything this is what happens.<br />On power up all LEDs but the WiFi&#039;s flash once.<br />Then all but the Power LED go off and then the active LAN&#039;s LED blinks a couple of times and stays on.<br />SYS LED does not blink at all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I tried starting with either the reset or the QSS or both buttons pressed, or pressing QSS or reset after a few seconds (as I cannot see the SYS going on to signal the best timing) to go to failsafe. Nothing ever changed anything and this is probably &quot;normal&quot; for a kernel panic.</p><p>Any suggestions? Can I tftp it any other way?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gulliverrr</strong> on 2 Nov 2011, 18:00)</p>
