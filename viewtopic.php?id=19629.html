					<p>I played a bit with Ti AR7 port on D-Link 504T device.</p><p>While basically it boots and works, I got the following issue: ADSL lamp blinks quickly and it appears there is at least attempts to establish DSL link? But I see no boot log or dmesg records anyhow related to ADSL nor I can see any interface related to ADSL, etc. How can I use DSL connection with AR7 port? Are there something special required to get it working? Any hints? Technically I need PPPoA, I do have proper VPI and VCI numbers and login and password but where to I have to supply all this? Are there some documentation describing this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Very useful, thanks!</p><p>I have to admit that requirement to install something usually implies there is network is up and running. How can I install something if network is not operable? That&#039;s just like old pkunzip.zip joke - you need to download something for networking device over network while usually it is AR7 device who provides access to network and network is down if device can&#039;t provide access to network! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. So, all needed packages SHOULD pre-exist in constructed firmware image - BEFORE I&#039;m going to flash firmware.</p><p>As far as I know, in recent Kamikaze there is at least added ADSL Annex A firmware. I hope PPPoE and PPPoA also added - haven&#039;t tried myself recent Kamikaze yet since I had enough headache with recovery of AR7 device when it has turned out that I can&#039;t get network up and running with OpenWRT and device has been a &quot;gateway&quot; so I had no choice but to restore stock firmware to get network up and running.</p><p>Let&#039;s say is a bit PITA with their stupid ADAM2 boot loader (it had some compatibility issues so TFTP upload was aborted at the middle, etc). All this actually discourages testing Kamikaze on AR7 pretty much (I had 2 days of headache and internet downtime after attempt to test OpenWRT on my AR7 device).</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; Anyway, keeping another working modem around is very useful when playing with an AR7 wink<br />I&#039;m noticed this. And uhm, I should &quot;type&quot; these word in stone. Because when I had to fallback to original firmware (thanks to missing stuff), it has turned out ADAM2 had some compatibility issues with my OS (Ubuntu) on IP layer so TFTP upload rather looked like a Russian Roulette. Where I have to hit Zero sector, nothing more, nothing less. TFTP upload to ADAM2 usually stopped in the middle with high chances and only way to go was to &quot;win&quot; on this &quot;roulette&quot; (one try from 30 or so succeeded after all, uploading ALL data, he-he <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />). Should I admit I hate this [bugged] ADAM2 stuff?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Drone</strong> on 22 Jun 2009, 23:01)</p>
