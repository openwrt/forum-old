					<p>Dear fellow members,</p><p>I really need some help. I am a total noob and need some help. I was looking for a device which could convert my hard disk into a NAS (Network acess storage) device, something I could add as a network device on my PC and access. If not, atleast a device which can provide FTP access to my hard disk using Filezilla. Dlink DIR 505 was something the retailer promised could do (he just said it will help me share media across phones and PC using HDD). Given NAS devices are not easily available in stores nearby, I got the DLink DIR 505 for myself.</p><p>While this thing does partially what the retailer says, it is not exactly what I hoped for.</p><p>1) HDD, even after providing extra power using dual usb port, does not seem to be shown as a storage in shareport<br />2) USB device, though detected, can be accessed only by using the shareport web link (191.168.0.1:8181). Pointing filezilla for ftp does not work and I even cannot use the hard disk as a wifi drive.</p><p>I spent some time surfing openwrt and stumbled across this forum. My question is would the steps suggested by masamunecyrus here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=230861#p230861">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 61#p230861</a> , help me get the ftp or NAS protocol running??? If not, is there&nbsp; any alternative to make it work or I would need a different NAS device altogether? Hoping for an early response and apologies if I sound like a noob.</p><p>Thank you,</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, if you install OpenWRT you can use this device as a NAS with various protocols.</p><p>The easiest file-serving protocol is just ssh with various client tools (scp, or sftp-like clients).&nbsp; Learn how to use ssh, if you don&#039;t already know it.&nbsp; You may be able to install OpenWRT without it, but it is very useful for troubleshooting.</p><p>If you use Windows, I would take a look at Putty.&nbsp; It may also have the ftp-like client that you need to access the files from your PC.</p><p>OpenWRT comes with an ssh server, so you don&#039;t need to install it.&nbsp; You do need to install some software in order to use the USB disk, as described here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage</a></p><p>I have done this and used it with a FAT32 flash drive, an ext2 flash drive, and an NTFS hard disk (read-only).</p><p>I installed OpenWRT by installing the OpenWRT firmware from the standard web ui of the device:<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-505-a1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />I did not use the &quot;emergency restore mode&quot;.</p><p>You can then follow the &quot;firstlogin&quot; instructions to setup a password, and use the OpenWRT web interface (Luci) to upload a second firmware file:<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-505-a1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />I&#039;m not sure what you gain by installing the sysupgrade file.&nbsp; OpenWRT also works without it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello everybody,<br />I was trying to put the slider/switch to use (DIR-505L A2). It was easy to enable the GPIOs 19 and 20 as input. I can get their value (eg via cat) manually but I couldn’t find a way to get them working automatically via /etc/rc.button (I even googled for that problem). I tried &quot;gpio&quot; and &quot;sysfs&quot; as name but I doesn&#039;t seem to be working Now my question is: what is the proper name for the rc.button-file or rather what is the correct way to use them.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/rc.button# cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio

 gpio-20  (sysfs               ) in  hi    
...</code></pre></div><p>(Modified reboot script(quick and dirty))<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

					<p>It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve looked at OpenWrt on DIR-505, so I&#039;d appreciate if anyone could address a few questions:<br />1. There&#039;s just one three-position switch, is it represented by two binary GPIOs (19 &amp; 20)?<br />2.
