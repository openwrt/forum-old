					<p>I just got this one thinking I was ordering a U25AWF.&nbsp; The listing on aliexpress said model:U25AWF but the photos were of the U25WF.&nbsp; However with this one there is a metal box over all the chips.&nbsp; Some sort of heat sink I guess.&nbsp; So I can&#039;t confirm it&#039;s a MT7620.&nbsp; Is there a way I can do it through a terminal on a pc connected up to the device.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I compiled firmware for a router and replaced it.&nbsp; The last time was a router I put DD-WRT on.&nbsp; So I&#039;m hoping someone compiled openwrt with good features built in already and could post a link to the firmware.&nbsp; I&#039;ll use imagebuilder if I know the patch is in there.</p><p>Mine should be the MT7620 because it has the 2nd antenna running down the side of the hdd compartment, not like the one on the russian link.</p><p>I ended up flashing the U25AWF firmware from PhuongLM with hdd spindown and some other goodies.&nbsp; I figured since it has the same processor and had the same interface as the U25AWF it would work.&nbsp; It did.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tested everything but I got the wifi/lan to work and connected to it and can get the Luci interface.&nbsp; I&#039;m just so new to OpenWRT that the interface is a little confusing.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to setup a torrent client that I can use in luci and getting a wifi repeater setup.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen lots of guides.&nbsp; Still confused.&nbsp; I&#039;ll figure it out.&nbsp; This will hold me off until I figure out how to compile my own.&nbsp; </p><p>Honestly the interface that Blueendless had on it was version 1.3.3&nbsp; it wasn&#039;t bad.&nbsp; No samba though and I wanted samba.&nbsp; All it has was FTP.&nbsp; It did have a torrent client already, wifi repeater that worked well.&nbsp; The English on it was awful and the torrent client was in Chinese but using google translate I could figure it out.&nbsp; </p><p>Eventually I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get OpenWRT to have all those features and more........ It&#039;s just a nice learning curve with OpenWRT.&nbsp; </p><p>Just an update for anyone with this unit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to run it though it with the firmware mentioned.&nbsp; So far everything works.&nbsp; USB works with a flash drive and shared the usb with Samba.&nbsp; So apparently the U25WF and U25AWF are pretty much identical as long as it has the same SOC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not found anything that doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Now I just need to figure out how to compile it so I can get all the features I want.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>prisoner1969</strong> on 6 Jul 2016, 17:52)</p>

					<p>Patch is already applied in the build that&#039;s on the link.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t compile it.&nbsp; If you look at the previous post it was compiled by PhuongLM.&nbsp; Access the drive by usb3 cable that came with the unit.&nbsp; Once you set up the network share in the menu, you can access the drive by samba.&nbsp; Browse your network in whatever operating system you are using and you should see the share.&nbsp; That&#039;s after you connect either by WIFI or ethernet.&nbsp; You must connect by ethernet cable first to enable the wifi.&nbsp; Wifi by default is turned off.&nbsp; You can also install an ftp server on the unit using the Luci interface and access it by FTP if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; I prefer samba.</p><p>Of course you have to format the drive before being able to use it.&nbsp; I did that while connected via the usb3 cable.</p><p>I&#039;m not proficient to compile my own version yet.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting a second unit as a backup.&nbsp; Once I get a working knowledge of compiling my own firmware I&#039;ll test it on my backup so as to keep my main unit working.&nbsp; My new one is a U25AWF with the nice heatsink.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll probably make that one my main working unit and use the U25WF as my firmware testing unit.&nbsp; Since they are identical in almost every way the firmware works on both.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>prisoner1969</strong> on 27 Jul 2016, 23:09)</p>
