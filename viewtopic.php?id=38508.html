					<p>I am using wndr3700 with &quot;Luci QoS&quot;, but the current trunk version, which is built on Codel logic. Continuous download speed yesterday was about 6 MB/s while upload at the same time was 0.5 MB/s. Ping latency was still low. (I have 110/5 Mb/s cable connection, so those speeds match that quite well.)</p><p>&quot;Latest Backfire&quot; is a contradictory concept, as most of the code is from March 2010 (10.03). Backfire has an old QoS module, which is not quite that good. (Also remember to adjust the speed limits on that QoS Luci page.)</p><p>I would strongly suggest that you jump from old Backfire to Attitude Adjustment trunk. It works ok.<br />If you want ready images for wndr3700, you can try these:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27722</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 6 Aug 2012, 09:04)</p>

					<p>@AndyInNYC: did you set the upload/download speed for QOS?<br />And make sure you set all VOIP-Traffic to Express. If your asterixbox, is only for VOIP you could just make QOS-rules for its IP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Reserve in the last posting is a misstatement.&nbsp; I want all bandwidth available for normal uses.&nbsp; If a VOIP call is being made, I want to throttle back all the other uses so that I have bandwidth for the call without issues.</p><p>I don&#039;t want too much bandwidth being allocated for the call, nor do I want X% of my available bandwidth held in reserve in case I should make a phone call.</p><p>As a further hitch, I have an AT&amp;T MCell (micro cell) which captures my cell calls and runs them out over my broadband (I get terrible local AT&amp;T reception).&nbsp; Obviously I don&#039;t want to impair these calls either.&nbsp; I need to check, but let&#039;s pretend that the Micro Cell is 192.168.40.200 on the network.</p><p>Thanks again for any help you may provide.</p><p>Andrew</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all, the values to enter in the qos configuration are your maximal net bandwidth minus some headroom that qos needs to be effective (I hink this is no longer true for the post-backfire codel-based qos). Especially the upload value needs to be lower than the maximum you observed empirically.</p><p>I have a &quot;up to&quot; 16Mbit / 1Mbit line. The observed actual net rates are for me about 12Mbit and 950 kbit respectively. I hence entered this in the qos config</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  option download     12000  
  option upload       800</code></pre></div><p>Since you cannot control downstream in a meaningful manner I left it at 12000, but upstream needs the headroom and through testing with simultaneous saturating upload traffic and pings I settled on 800.</p><br /><p>I also have this stanza</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>onfig classify                      
 option target       &quot;Express&quot;
