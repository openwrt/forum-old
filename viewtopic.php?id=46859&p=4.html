					<p>Hi,</p><p>first of all thanks for this firmware. It works really good and better than the stock one.</p><p>I have two questions for you FriedZombie:</p><p>1. Can you please build the firmware again with the latest commits or give as a git repo where you have your environment so we can build it by ourself using exactly your configuration?<br />2. I see that the repeater is going at last at 150Mbps of 300 available and I&#039;m using 40HT+ as sta+ap configuration actually. Am I missing something that I cannot push it to work at 300Mbps?</p><p>Greets,<br />Julian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JulianXhokaxhiu</strong> on 19 Mar 2014, 11:50)</p>

					<p>Ok, I am in need of some help. I have successfully flashed my wa750re in the past and went back to factory. I decided last night that I wanted to give it a go again. I updated through the OEM firmware upgrade option and it rebooted. Now I get the the RE, Power and Ethernet lights only. I can ping it and I can access it through failsafe mode, but no wireless signal. I have been trying to figure out how to flash it again. I read about the sysupgrade command, but I am lost on how to get the firmware into the tmp directory to do the sysupgrade. If I use the wget command it tells me download.openwrt.org (or whatever the name is) is no good. Any instructions or point me to a &quot;guide for dummies&quot; would be very helpful. Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys, noobie here. </p><p>I need your help. I&#039;m very new to this whole thing. Today I flashed the gargoyle firmware to my tp-link wa750re. Everything went fine, the flash was successful. With an ethernet cable I was able to access the web UI (on 192.168.1.1), and I configured to use it as a wifi extender. Everything seemed fine again. it said it needs to reboot. So it did. Since than I cannot access the web UI, and cannot connect to the wifi it generates either. (I know the pass for sure). I tried to reset it with the reset button, but had no luck with it. My question is: how could I change everything to the defaults so I can access the webUI?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>soadzoor</strong> on 6 Jul 2014, 02:11)</p>
