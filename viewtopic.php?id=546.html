					<p>Hi,<br />I want to use OpenWRT on my Ravotek WRT54G (very similar to the Belkin 7230, if not the same).</p><p>I downloaded the buildroot-20040916, let it build (with pppoecd embedded), prepended the (PMON?-)Header to the trx file and loaded&nbsp; it to the router.<br />It boots fine but won&#039;t connect to my ISP via PPPOE.</p><p>The nvram-setup seemed to be fine, so I tried pppoecd with param &quot;-d&quot; (and username&amp;password) and it just printed &quot;Sending PADI&quot; and timed out,<br />it doesn&#039;t retrieve any data from the modem, the wan-interface (eth1) also just shows TX and no RX.</p><p>Furthermore, does someone know how I can get wlan up on this router, the belkin firmware does the job, but no Linksys-like firmware.<br />Does that depend on the miniPCI interface on my router?<br />It&#039;s not that critical because I don&#039;t use wlan at the moment, but it would be fine being able to run it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks,<br />antimac.</p>									</div>

					<p>Big mistake of me.<br />I think the pppoe problem came from the et drivers, I think in /et/sys/etc-47xx.c (may test this later when no one needs the net-connection <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />).</p><p>The wlan-card problem should has been in the /shared/sbpci.c, a 4712-&quot;Workaround&quot; denied my router to probe the mini-PCI, there&#039;s no need to use the belkin wl-module-binaries, those packaged works well (as far as I tested <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />).</p><p>I appended a patch for bcm94710r4 (check with &#039;nvram get boardtype&#039;) boards, to be applied from buildroot.

					<p>Can&#039;t help you on how to get openwrt on it. However, with only 2M flash, it is unlikely you can squeeze openswan into it. Even the bare system is a bit tight, you may need to give up the jffs2 in order for it to function. </p><p>The only way I see to have openwrt working on this 2M device is to use NFS, i.e. boot into the bare openwrt which is a standard feature NAT router(already quite flexible and powerful) then chroot/pivot_root to a nfs root. The only issue seems to be it that it would be a bit noisy for a 24/7 NFS server in a home. May be get the NSLU2 as the server. But why not get a better one in the first place,&nbsp; WRT54G(S) is pretty cheap now and the WL500G even has USB port.</p><p>I have a V2 which has only 4M flash and is already pretty tight to have my desired feature on it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello all,</p><br /><p>&nbsp; The Belkin F5D7230-4 Serial Console document has been published.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>The work of the first paper has been widely accepted, but successful deployment of
OpenWRT has not ensued. Hidden or unknown errors in the boot process have lead
the author to seek a means for attaining console access so that productive debugging
(rather than guesswork) could be employed in the development process.

By collating a mass of publicly available information, and experimenting with a single
unit, the paper concludes by providing a physical console into the device, providing
local root user level access, and a schematic diagram for a solder-less project that will
allow individuals to try this experiment for themselves. It is hoped that this
information can be used to debug open source firmware and to then adapt the
OpenWRT, and Sveasoft, embedded Linux distributions for this Belkin router.</code></pre></div><p>Document URL;<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://midnightcode.org/papers/OpenWRT%20on%20the%20Belkin%20F5D7230-4%20-%20Serial%20Console.pdf">http://midnightcode.org/papers/OpenWRT% … onsole.pdf</a></p><p>Document Directory URL;<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://midnightcode.org/papers/">http://midnightcode.org/papers/</a></p><br /><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>The latest paper is completed; <br />&nbsp; OpenWRT on the Belkin F5D7230-4 - Compiling and Installing the GPL Broadcom Reference Firmware</p><br /><p>&nbsp; &quot;<br />&nbsp; Belkin published the Broadcom reference firmware; <br />&nbsp; a small Linux distribution, designed to act as a&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; proof-of-concept and development environment for&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; the Belkin engineers. To minimize the amount of&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; experimentation required to adapt the OpenWRT and <br />&nbsp; Sveasoft firmware for use on the Belkin, the&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; published Broadcom reference firmware was compiled <br />&nbsp; to see if it was functional, and able to provide&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; driver and configuration information for the open <br />&nbsp; source distributions. <br />&nbsp; ... <br />&nbsp; Furthermore, this process was developed rapidly <br />&nbsp; due to the excellent work performed by Rick <br />&nbsp; Bronson.
