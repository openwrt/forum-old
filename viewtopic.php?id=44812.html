					<p>Hello, I found several tutorials, how to control scanner from openwrt terminal or from web gui, seems doable, but I&#039;d like to make idiot proof scanning solution with low power consumption, which would require put paper into scanner and press one of the buttons on the scanner, simple like fax.</p><p>What I don&#039;t know is how to detect the event, that some of the scanner buttons has been pressed on the usb scanner. Is it possible at all? Could someone please tell me?</p><p><em>The background for anyone, whos interested:</em></p><p><em>I have some old canon usb scanner and I need wifi router (as client) to get connectivity to the workplace at the store, so I was thinking about buying cheap tp link wr842nd which has 8MB flash+usb and using this old scanner.</em></p><p><em>The goal is to scan papers to the ftp instead of faxing them out, then scanning on the other side and saving them to ftp. It should be easy for store workes, who are masters at driving a forklift, but don&#039;t know anyhing about computers and computer is not needed there anyway.</em></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, guys! The wps button seems like a great idea, should be easy, because it is supported in openwrt directly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But I will look into the HID solution first, because the wps button probably would not last long <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if scanbuttond would detect anything since it&#039;s just a daemon like triggerhappy.</p><p>Might be more modules are needed for HID buttons, might be polled buttons.
