					<p>I am using Luci to manage my OpenWrt router. Being a newbie, I only know very basic commands in SSH (like opkg), so I need some help.</p><p>I have a password set on my OpenWrt router, but I do not want to take the chance that a hacker could brute force my password, so I want to make sure all forms of remote access are completely disabled.</p><p>OpenWrt&#039;s HOWTO (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/secure.access">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/secure.access</a>) suggests doing this by:</p><p>1. Not offer access from the Internet at all, or allow only from certain IP addresses or IP-address ranges<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A. by make the ssh-server dropbear and the Web-Server uhttpd not listen on the external Ethernet port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B. by blocking incoming connections to those ports (tcp 22, 80 and 443) in your firewall</p><p>Since I&#039;m a total newbie to OpenWrt, I&#039;m not sure how to do this. (How can I not offer access from the Internet at all?) I didn&#039;t know how to configure dropbear to not offer any Internet access, so I did this in SSL:</p><p>opkg remove dropbear</p><p>Does this solve my problem? Is there an alternative? I&#039;m afraid to remove uhttpd because I&#039;m not sure what it does.</p><p>I also want to block incoming connections to the ports 22, 80, and 443 in my firewall. Do the default traffic rules in Luci already do this, or do I have to add explicit block rules?</p><p>Please let me know if I&#039;m omitting anything. I don&#039;t need any kind of remote access, and I just want to turn it off completely.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>onewhoprowls</strong> on 23 Mar 2013, 06:18)</p>

					<p>Yes, securing you router is possible. However, you need to understand what the current status is now before you make any changes. The wiki page is describing the concept of securing a router, but this doesn&#039;t mean that your router is in this state now. </p><p>Removing dropbear is not the way to go about it though - you now cannot SSH into the router even from within your own network.</p><p>To start, re-install drobear:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install dropbear</code></pre></div><p>enable it to start at boot:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/dropbear enable</code></pre></div><p>and start the dropbear process:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/dropbear start</code></pre></div><p>Confirm you can log back into the router and we&#039;ll proceed from there.</p><p>*Mod - suggest moving this to the general discussion forum *</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting, I never quite understood that section. Just to be clear, &quot;input&quot; means from left to right (e.g. WAN to everywhere, or LAN to WAN), and output is right to left, right?</p><p>I was confused because under LAN to WAN, &quot;output&quot; is &quot;accept&quot; by default.

You&#039;d have to re-install via luci.</p><p>At the outset, you stated that there were two objectives that you were pursuing:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>onewhoprowls wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1. Not offer access from the Internet at all, or allow only from certain IP addresses or IP-address ranges<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A. by make the ssh-server dropbear and the Web-Server uhttpd not listen on the external Ethernet port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B. by blocking incoming connections to those ports (tcp 22, 80 and 443) in your firewall</p></blockquote></div><p>Others have discussed the second point here and this is certainly an efficient way to enforce general security policy.&nbsp; </p><p>It is still desirable though to configure the SSH server (dropbear by default) to only listen on particular interfaces and achieve the first suggestion (be that lan or a particular SVI / vlan interface). For example, if you only want to have dropbear listen on your lan interface (ie. remote access is impossible even if the port was not blocked explicitly by the firewall), execute:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].Interface=lan
uci commit dropbear</code></pre></div><p>You may also like to choose a high non-standard port for SSH (eg. 52,415):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].Port=52415
uci commit dropbear</code></pre></div><p>An even more secure move would be to disable password authentication and require SSH keys instead. This is discussed here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/dropbearpublickeyauthenticationhowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/dropbea … ationhowto</a></p><p>You&#039;ll have to make your own determination as to whether this is right for you network though.&nbsp; In any case, I&#039;d always advise having a serial connection (even one by a usb adapter) just in case something went wrong.</p>									</div>
