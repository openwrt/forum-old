					<p>Hello,</p><p>Today I wanted to switch from DD-WRT to OpenWRT to have more functionality. Before I was able to flash OpenWRT I noticed, that the Webinterface of DD-WRT was not reachable ( blank page ). After further investigation, a lot of the services of DD-WRT were not running anymore and almost nothing was working.</p><p>So I wanted to remove DD-WRT and replace it with OpenWRT, but I had some trouble finding a way to flash it.</p><p>I am able to ping the router, connect to ssh (although my username and password are not recognized), connect to wifi, use DHCP etc.</p><p>I tried a hard reset (30/30/30) several times but nothing happened. I also tried to set my IP to static 192.168.0.66 and started a TFTP server to serve a new firmware to my router ( like described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4900">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4900</a> ), but the file was never fetched. The router just instantly boots up and is in the same situation.</p><p>What can I now do to remove DD-WRT and install OpenWRT ?</p><p>Since this is not directly DD-WRT related I do hope you will be able to help me.</p><p>Best Regards</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the answers. I tried to flash the firmware again with the files dabyd64 provided, but it still seems to not be working.</p><p>The router just starts up, all leds (exept for the 2 wifi leds) are lighing up, then all leds exept for the power led turn off and the lan port 1 led starts to flash. Seconds after this, the lan led stops flashing for a few seconds. Then it starts flashing again and the wifi led turns on (I guess dd-wrt is starting at that point). (I can upload a video if you like)</p><p>The TFTP Server does not give any messeges. Here is a screenshot of my lan interface configuration :</p><p><a href="http://oi59.tinypic.com/b65340.jpg">http://oi59.tinypic.com/b65340.jpg</a></p><p>Windows firewall is turned off btw.</p><p>Is there something I could be doing wrong ?</p><p>EDIT: When my the router is turned off tftp32.exe shows 127.0.0.1 as IP-Adress. Is there a possibility that it recognizes the new IP (192.168.0.66) too late ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Steve192</strong> on 12 Jun 2014, 18:02)</p>

					<p>All seems OK. For me it worked, and I was using windows 8. Remember to set your ethernet as &quot;work network&quot;, not public, maybe it blocks that connections in public mode.<br />Are you running TFTPD32 as admin? (Right clic-&gt;open as administrator)<br />I think it&#039;s some program that blocks the connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange thing. Although tftpd32 puts 127.0.0.1, this is only due the fact that the LAN interface is down, and works when you power the router.<br />I made a small video:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54PAS0gvW2k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54PAS0gvW2k</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that adapter should work.</p><p>I have a v1.3, but mine has green LEDs, yours has blue. Not that the TFTP feature is implemented in the LEDs, but it&#039;s still a difference. Do you remember what firmware your WDR4900 shipped with, or did you update to latest stock firmware before flashing DD-WRT? The TFTP reset button method may only be implemented in the most recent firmware, I think it was first discovered last year. My WDR4900 shipped with 130424, and I&#039;ve used the TFTP recovery without issue.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if the Wi-Fi toggle will do anything, but no harm trying it in both positions. The reset button should be pressed and held before you power the router on, and until the transfer is finished.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope, I have no idea ... <br />I have a newer bootloader version ( U-Boot 2010.12-svn18602, the tutorial used U-Boot 2010.12-svn15934 ) so maybe they removed the possibility to start the tftp client by pressing the reset button. But I could not imagine why to do this.</p><p>Another possibility would be that the physical reset button is somehow damaged since there is no reaction when I pressed it, not even with dd-wrt &quot;booted&quot; (it should erase nvram if pressed in dd-wrt).</p><p>Anyway I now flashed the firmware with the serial cable and it worked. ( I had to turn off &quot;append LF&quot; to get to the command prompt and turn it back on to enter commands )</p><p>Thanks for the help everybody <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
