					<p>Hello all!</p><p>I have just started working all of this out, so I am happy to be here!</p><p>My question is this:</p><p>Has anyone ever thought of using those really cheap USB to ETHERNET converters?</p><p>(ex: <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2703732&amp;CatId=589)">http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/ … CatId=589)</a><br />^^ That one is much more expensive, ebay has em at 2 dollars</p><p>I understand that it is meant to convert ethernet to usb for people without an ethernet card.</p><p>My idea is, why not use it the other way around? Connect the ethernet to a router, then USB to an device.</p><p>I know there is (probably) a driver involved, but I/anyone interested could write one.</p><br /><p>Failing that, there is the more circuits route:<br />Use this Ethernet to SPI Host: ENC28J60 Stand-Alone Ethernet Controller with SPI Interface <br />THen SPI to USB:&nbsp; MAX3420E&nbsp; &nbsp; USB Peripheral Controller with SPI Interface</p><p>Also probably involves a driver.</p><br /><p>My goal is to use a cheap router but add on USB functionality. </p><p>I want to keep budget low, but USB is really attractive.</p><p>The whole point is to put a router (like WRT54GL) on a robot, then attach all sensors/inputs (including video, hence serial is out of the question)<br />to transmit to a receiving computer. There, a lot more processing and remote control can take place than on the robot. I will be sure to document it here if anyone wants to know.</p><p>Thanks for your time. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>EDIT: This one might work as well: &nbsp; &nbsp; LAN9500-ABZJ USB 2.0 ETHER CTRLR</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Maeth</strong> on 22 Apr 2009, 08:30)</p>

					<p>Yup, MMCM is right.&nbsp; You cannot do this without it costing you $$$, because the moment the word &#039;USB host&#039; instead<br />of &#039;USB device&#039; is used the price goes up significantly.&nbsp; </p><p>USB Hosts involve endpoint descriptors, transfer descriptors, DMA, handling of connection, disconnection events,<br />figuring out what speed the device is, how much power it takes, enumeration of hubs, and a bunch of other things.</p><p>USB devices consist of just endpoint(s) that you can shove data into/out of and can be very basic.</p><p>Also putting the words Ethernet and Microcontroller into the same sentence seems to involve rather high costs too, <br />although I&#039;ve never understood why.</p><p>&lt;shameless plug&gt;<br />Bifferboard might be a reasonable platform to attempt something like this, but it&#039;s a bit more than 2 dollars.<br />(<a href="http://www.bifferos.com">www.bifferos.com</a>).<br />&lt;/shameless plug&gt;</p><p>I&#039;ve seen some custom devices which simply accept ethernet frames and send them onto USB (used<br />in conjunction with Windows drivers on the client), but they are not much cheaper than a Bifferboard.</p><p>If you are interested in the Bifferboard, for this though, don&#039;t order it just yet.&nbsp; The next firmware version is<br />due out in about a week and will allow a kind of BIOS extension, so you can program it rather more like a microcontroller, and less like a Linux system.&nbsp; Maybe useful for robotics.</p><p>regards,<br />Biff.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Maeth, a few thoughts and tradeoffs</p><p>I suppose you already went through the list of supported hardware and scanned for those routers with USB 2.0 ports? Wouldn&#039;t a simple usb host work for you? Some of those go for ~50 bucks, some have 2 USB ports (options, options!), various brands depending on where you live.</p><p>For flexible input/output/timing, maybe scan for devices with mini-PCI inside. Lose the wireless, gain a standard PCI port. This tradeoff presents industrial-grade possibilities.</p><p>Usb-ethernet adapters may or may not offer decent throughput, often worse latency/jitter than you&#039;d get from a 1995 10Mbps ISA card... The format factor is cool, if you can tolerate the lousy performance AND have drivers for the chip inside. </p><p>Same caution on usb-wireless (eg: <a href="http://kakaku.com/item/00776011142/">http://kakaku.com/item/00776011142/</a> ), convenience vs. performance.</p><p>OTOH, tiny-footprint large-storage is easy for personal use, up to at least 32GB eg. with RMUM / ?BSCRMSDCBK. Thanks to generic storage class, no driver issues under any OS.<br />(eg. <a href="http://portablemonkey.com/article/got-my-buffalo-micro-usb-reader-rmum-2g-bk/">http://portablemonkey.com/article/got-m … mum-2g-bk/</a> )<br />8GB works for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Would even qualify for certain industrial scenarios!</p><p>Typical consumer routers (target OpenWRT platform) as of 2008 handle decent video flow, but not quite video processing.&nbsp; Consider many mini-ITX boards, where the CPU is an order of magnitude &quot;faster&quot; than your typical OpenWRT box, still choke on video display, let alone arbitrary video processing.</p><p>Depending on your constraints, you could also consider prototyping with<br />- low-power industrial Soekris gear (http://www.soekris.com/)<br />- hobby-oriented Via mini-ITX format? (eg. <a href="http://www.mini-box.com/)">http://www.mini-box.com/)</a><br />- or maybe even eee/umpc<br />If your goal is up to double-digit quantities (as opposed to mass-production 10k+ units), generic devices could be much easier and possibly cheaper to work with than more specialised+optimised gear.</p><p>hapy hacking <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
