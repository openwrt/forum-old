					<p>If you can live with slooooooow swap... probably yes. Last time I measured throughput I ended up with something about 200kB/s.<br />Make sure that your SD mod will work with a 1GB card (I have tested several cards up to 512MB - successfully - but there have been reports of failure).<br />Kernel building instructions have been spotted in the wiki,</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, has anyone tested to increase the memory of 16M to 32M or more?<br />I think more memory can execute more program and can increase the speed and stability of hard works,such as BT and Emule,is that true?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sdzx</strong> on 13 Jun 2006, 05:48)</p>

					<p>I have looked around on how to build portable apps on <a href="http://portableapps.com">http://portableapps.com</a>/ which are designed for USB flash drives and remember the author specifically talking about methods of reducing cache, swap, etc to flash devices b/c it will destroy the flash device after so many writes. I am not certain of the differences b/w SD and other flash technologies as far as how many writes / flashes until that area of the chip goes bad but you may want to consider this as a swap partition may wear the chip away.</p><p>You could always buy older chips on sale once every 6 months though.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have 20M of Swapspace on a SD-Card, just because one can do that. If its reasonable, i don&#039;t know... since the cards are cheap, i don&#039;t care if it&#039;s destroyed or useless. Perhaps it gets usefull if i load more work onto the router...</p><p>Unfortunatelly i lost the step-by-step tutorial i wrote while building the image via the image-builder, but because of much smoother ways to get swap onto the SD-Card, it&#039;s not that big loss. But i have the whole root filesystem on the SD-Card and don&#039;t use the build-in read-write flash. Thus, i get another _fast_ empty storage, but i don&#039;t use this either 0o.</p><p>For simple swap on the sd-card, simply get the mmc.o somewhere for your kernel (not that hard via some search engine [or just ask]), or read instructions to build it yourself (harder). Additional, some filesystem modules via ipkg ... kmod-ext2/ext3 or whatever you like most. Last but not least, you might need e2fsprogs to format your card. Write some nifty initscript, and you are done.</p><p>The only odd think i encountered was some limitation on the filesize of the swapfiles, but i didn&#039;t investigated this and simply created two times 10M.</p>									</div>

					<p>As said, the way i got my swap on the sd-card is very complex and propably not what one might want to use.</p><p>The first step was to get the whole root filesystem on the sd-card, as described in <a href="http://cryptomilch.de/~ulmen/openwrt/rootonmmchowto">http://cryptomilch.de/~ulmen/openwrt/rootonmmchowto</a>.<br />At this point, i would recommend just to mount the sd-card anywhere and use this mountpoint instead of /etc below instead of using my howto. The following steps apply either way.</p><p>Having a read-writeable root (or a read-writeable mountpoint), simply create a emtpy file of the desired size anywhere.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/etc/swapfile count=&lt;desired size in blocks&gt;</code></pre></div><p>This may take quite long, because the speed of the sd-card is very poor.</p><p>Then, turn the file into a swapfile.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mkswap /etc/swapfile</code></pre></div><p>The last step is to write a initscript to autoenable the swap at boot-time.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vi /etc/init.d/S15swapon
#!/bin/sh
swapon /etc/swapfile</code></pre></div><p>and make it executable with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod +x /etc/init.d/S15swapon</code></pre></div><p>Reboot or execute it by hand to have the swap enabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>As I see the idea here is to have more RAM.</p><p>Could the following approach be applied?<br />OS kernel itself and root-file system to be built for execution in-place (XIP) in the board flash – not compressed, and not copied to RAM? <br />I guess it will require a lot of changes – boot-loader, kernel, the image, but it will save some RAM usage.</p>									</div>

Thus, it was decided that compressing the kernel and root filesystem was more important and no effort was spent on XIP.</p><p>SD is one of the few cases for XIP, but you won&#039;t be able to use it on the root filesystem (sd isn&#039;t direclty accessable) so the only place you&#039;ll be able to use it is the kernel. The amount of RAM you&#039;d save, is limited by your ability to use the flash, meaning the most you&#039;d save is maybe 3M. Is it really worth the trouble?</p>									</div>
