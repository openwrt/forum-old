					<p>The problem is not obtaining the packages but rather getting them on the router to install them.

					<p>PPPoA support is not included with the standard image because not everyone needs it and it takes up quite a lot of space (there is no way to free up that space for pre-installed packages). It&#039;s unfortunate in your case, and one could make an argument to include it for models like yours, but that&#039;s the way things are right now.</p><p>The simplest way would be to temporarily hook up your WAN port (the grey one I assume) to a LAN port of an existing router.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>In short, OpenWRT is modular.&nbsp; Most users don&#039;t and won&#039;t need PPPoA so it&#039;s a package added via opkg.&nbsp; You need to learn what the processor/SoC architecture of your router is, that is, if your router uses the ar71xx architecture or, if not, what it uses.&nbsp; You can find it in the table of hardware:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p><p>Then look here:</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/</a></p><p>You can find the necessary package under that architecture subdirectory, for example:</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/packages/base/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … ages/base/</a></p><p>I strongly suspect that you can&#039;t download these packages using the default settings because the /etc/opkg.conf file is pointing to a source on downloads.openwrt.org which isn&#039;t working ATM.&nbsp; EDIT:&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; metai is right, if you&#039;re not connected to the Internet you won&#039;t be able to download.&nbsp; Sorry for my thick skull.</p><p>Then look below to learn more.&nbsp; You can do it without anyone holiding your hand!!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; The documentation is available, not too hard, and covers many topics in depth:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt</a></p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a></p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/">https://wiki.openwrt.org/</a></p><p>That should give you an excellent start.&nbsp; Good luck! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Clemmitt</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cmsigler</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 03:15)</p>

					<p>OK - thanks for all he above comments. I have a file on my computer now called: ppp-mod-pppoa_2.4.7-6_ppc44x.ipk (as recommended earlier) and as also suggested I need to find a way to get it on. I&#039;ll work my way through all the new comments and see if I need anything else (as it&#039;s not clear ATM) and then how to go about it. I guess what I&#039;m looking for at this stage is an article which tells me how to install ipk files. If PPPoA is left off as an added extra due to size or whatever reason then it would be nice to see a simple way of adding in these files. Maybe there is - I just haven&#039;t found it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ytrewq</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 04:17)</p>

As the OP seems new to all this, I&#039;ll just mention that PPPoA is PPP <em>over ATM</em>. If you need PPPoA to connect to your ISP you need an ATM interface. In layman terms, ATM interface == DSL modem chip. Most OpenWrt devices only have Ethernet and Wi-Fi hardware. OpenWrt does support a few DSL modems, but it is a small minority of the supported devices. On many devices with DSL modems, OpenWrt can run, but can&#039;t use the actual modem chip, so the device is only useful for Ethernet and Wi-Fi (all brcm63xx targets, for example).</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>ytrewq wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I have a file on my computer now called: ppp-mod-pppoa_2.4.7-6_ppc44x.ipk</p></blockquote></div><p>I don&#039;t see any mention of what hardware you have (make, model and <em>hardware version</em> (printed on label) of your device running OpenWrt) in this thread.

You have downloaded a file for the ppc44x architecture, and according to the wiki the only supported device on ppc44x is a development board (that doesn&#039;t have a DSL modem).</p><p>Edit: Never mind, you stated it was a Netgear DGND3700v1 in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=63239">your other thread</a>.

					<p>Thanks to all for your ideas. I&#039;d actually overcome all my previous problems and got as far as Puttying into the Netgear but it is rejecting the files. I&#039;m pretty sure they are the right files but from what I am reading it isn&#039;t going to work. Unless there is a miraculous cure in the wings it looks like I&#039;m going to have to revert to stock Netgear firmware - I&#039;m gutted. I also posses a Draytek Vigor 2820n which is crying out for OpenWrt but I can&#039;t find any open source firmware anywhere for Draytek, and I&#039;d still probably be up against PPPoA.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ytrewq</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 11:15)</p>

					<p>Thanks for all that Clemmitt. I&#039;ll try it out. From my perspective OpenWrt was something I wanted to try (I only partly knew what I was doing) and if I look in the supported hardware list and see my model listed then I assume it should be good to go or it wouldn&#039;t be there, as it wasn&#039;t for some time. I had no idea all these problems were going to arise. I don&#039;t recall seeing anything about PPPoA, at least anything I understood. Perhaps on the page showing my unit there should be a specific proviso; it would have saved me a lot of time and trouble. On the plus side, I&#039;ve used Putty and WinSRC for the first time (successfully) so I did learn something, even if it was the hard way. The Netgear CHK firmware file is already in the TMP folder waiting but so far it is being seen as the wrong file so I&#039;m going to follow your instructions and see if I can get past that.</p>									</div>

The wiki page in question is linked in every variant of the table of hardware, and the unsupported DSL modem is mentioned explicitly in the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all">extended ToH</a>. If you didn&#039;t see it, you did the bare minimal research. If you did see that some part of your device wasn&#039;t supported, and you didn&#039;t understand how that would affect you, and you knew you had a limited understanding of what you were doing, you should have asked prior to flashing.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Perhaps on the page showing my unit there should be a specific proviso; it would have saved me a lot of time and trouble.</p></blockquote></div><p>It probably would have. On the other hand, not counting <em>your posts, any quotes, or this post,</em> more than 1100 words have been written in this thread to try to help you. You&#039;re not the only one who has voluntarily spent time on your issue, and everyone could have spent much less in total if you spent five extra minutes on prior research using links and sources handed to you in the ToH.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 21:54)</p>

					<p>As somebody new to this it is not possible to read every single article as this involves trawling through a lot of information, some of which I understand and some of which I don&#039;t. An extra 5 minutes would not have changed anything. I read what I could and didn&#039;t go into this totally blindly but I have learned much along the way and will know what to expect if I try again in the future. I did see part of my unit was not supported but did not pick up on the PPPoA aspect and from the thread nor did others initially. We all have to start somewhere and it often involves some trial and error. I tried and got errors but thanks to Clemmitt who has been a star I now have my DGND3700 back to its original state.</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re a trooper Clemmitt. Some people don&#039;t understand what it is like for newbies but you are an exception. We all have to learn and you have taught me well. Thanks for all your help. I now know how to use WinSCP and Putty which are new to me and this will come in handy. The experience won&#039;t stop me trying again but will make me more cautious. Maybe I should just change ISP and specify PPPoE as the criteria.......... Actually, I have the opportunity to upgrade to a gigabit fibre connection so maybe I should just do that. The only issue is it would take the control of my modem out of my hands - maybe that&#039;s a good thing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ytrewq</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 23:48)</p>
