					<p>Hi people in the uk. Just a heads up to let you know that Vodaphone&#039;s new fibre broadband service is locked down and you can&#039;t use your own router, so no Openwrt.<br /><a href="https://forum.vodafone.co.uk/t5/Data-on-the-go/Vodafone-wont-allow-use-of-personal-routers-on-their-Broadband/td-p/2439326">https://forum.vodafone.co.uk/t5/Data-on … -p/2439326</a><br />I just got off the phone after receiving a text to my wife&#039;s phone offering us a really cheep deal on there broadband. The bloke I chatted to said that he&#039;s sticking with VM for his broadband as he is running a AC1900 with Openwrt on it and he likes it. lol </p><p>The hub they are giving out has no modem mode and they will not give out the PPOE username and password. I don&#039;t know why he could only tell me that it&#039;s company policy. So due to the strange rules I will be sticking with VM for now.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know that sucks (apart from Max), but maybe DMZ (with double nat) will solve your problem for a while. I used DMZ when UPC did not support bridge with their new modem. Luckily they updated firmware to support brige, probably because of business users, so I have full control again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 23 Aug 2016, 17:57)</p>

Their speed tiers 38 and 76 makes this look like a rather pedestrian VDSL2 FTTC product. Now they might not use PPPoE on top of that and hence do not require to give out passwords (e.g. dhcp option 82). But on the face of it it looks like they still use PPPoE (otherwise they would not claim that handing that information out diminishes security) and simply want to streamline their support costs...<br />Regarding FTTH just being one big LAN, as so often you are up to something but not there yet. In an attempt to cut down on keys pressed I will try a Hopper-style response:</p><p>PON vs. AON</p><p>But I will throw in an additional link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network</a> for the potential benefit of others...</p>									</div>

Could you at least try to read the posts you respond to, and/or verbosely formulate your responses so that is mere mortals have a chance following your thoughts (skip that arguments are enough, so explain your arguments a bit better).<br />High-rise UTP deployed at the last mile? Grasshopper you do not know the nasty story about the stamina of legacy infrastructure yet, so came close to the fire and let gran&#039;pa weave his yarn... In short the last mile consist out of unshielded twisted pair typically, but high-grade depends on the reference...<br />More relevant to this thread, FTTH just reuses the existing telephone wires, typically a single pair, that is good at its intended usage, but broadband simply did not exist when these networks where specified, planned, and built.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

The amazing thing in my eyes, actually is how much data can be pushed over these wires, given that hight bandwidth was never within scope of the original planners (well, most of the infrastructure was build before data transmission was&nbsp; thing for end users)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>
