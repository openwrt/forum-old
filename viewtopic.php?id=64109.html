					<p>any mt7620 (mt7620n or mt7620a) have an internal 5 port esw, this esw supports 16 vlan entries (vlan id 0-4095), so yes, generally all 7620 devices are vlan capable. One note i wanna mention - mt7620a devices have additional&nbsp; 2xRGMII and sometimes it used to connect external gsw (like archer c2) so in such case vlan capabilities will depend on external switch chip.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 11 Apr 2016, 20:53)</p>
