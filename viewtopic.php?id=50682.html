					<p>From looking at package/feeds/packages/gcc/Makefile, gcc is only built as a package for x86 architectures. I think you will have to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/crosscompile">cross compile</a>. Set up buildroot, then run make menuconfig, select your platform and profile, then run:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make tools/install &amp;&amp; make toolchain/install</code></pre></div><p>Which will build and set up the toolchain for your platform, without wasting time building an image you aren&#039;t going to use.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Unfortunately my knowledge compiling is somewhat limited&nbsp; and I&#039;m having some difficulties cross-compiling this.<br />I though since I&#039;m cross-compiling in other machine, why shouldn&#039;t I do it directly for the code I need (instead of cross-compiling&nbsp; gcc, put it in the router and then compile the code I need...).</p><p>I have built the buildroot environment and prepared the tools and toolchain. Just gave a try.</p><p>Preparing Environment variables:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PATH=$PATH:/mnt/storage/usbrelay-openwrt/openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/bin/

export STAGING_DIR</code></pre></div><p>According to the usbrelay site, the compiling should eb something like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># gcc -o usbrelay usbrelay.c -lhidapi-hidraw</code></pre></div><p> so I tryied<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/mnt/storage/usbrelay-openwrt/openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/bin/mips-openwrt-linux-gcc -o usbrelay usbrelay.c -lhidapi-hidraw

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code></pre></div><p>OK, it seems the HIDAPI library is missing so I git-cloned it from <a href="https://github.com/signal11/hidapi">https://github.com/signal11/hidapi</a> and tried to build it. However it has its own way of building:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make install     &lt;----- as root, or using sudo </code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m lost... How can I cross compile this?</p><p>Any suggestion?<br />Thanks<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again,</p><p>I have my own, strong and personal principle of not executing code that I don&#039;t know, because nobody never knows what it really does. It is a huge security risk!</p><p>Its a bit frustrating to have so near the supposed executable that does what is needed, and being unable to try it.</p><p>I mean, my OpenWRT router is the door between my Home LAN and the Internet. I don&#039;t want to risk having my Home LAN hacked just because I irresponsibly ran some executable that I don&#039;t know how it was done...</p><p>Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying the executable in the other post is malicious. I&#039;m just saying I don&#039;t execute code in my router that I don&#039;t know where it comes from. I&#039;m sure we all agree the best security rule is to always suspect from everything and everywhere.</p><p>So, since I couldn&#039;t get any help compiling the code for USBRelay, I decided to purchase another USB relay device, this one with a serial-over-usb port.<br />It is still on its way, so I haven&#039;t tried it, but I expect to easily control it with a serial console program like minicom. This device in ebay costs around $6 USD with shipping to EU, so its far less that I would spend with the hassle of being attacked in my Home LAN.</p><p>The best I can do is to suggest the OpenWRT community to adopt a conscientious&nbsp; behavior and avoid running code we don&#039;t know where it comes from.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>
