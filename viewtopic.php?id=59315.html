					<p>On the Mediatek i see that when i connect to an SSID, in my case it is on channel 6,&nbsp; that when i add client SSID&#039;s they also live at channel 6.&nbsp; Does this have anything to do with it?</p><p>The standard pre configured SSD (OpenWRT) was sitting on channel 1 or 10, can&#039;t remember.</p><p>So when i connected to the local hotspot at channel 6 i lost the OpenWRT that was on a different channel.<br />My feeling says this is somehow related, but i don&#039;t know if it is a bug, expected behaviour or maybe something that’s still on some dev&#039;s todo list.&nbsp; &nbsp;(to automagically reconfigure the OpenWRT SSID&#039;s channel to the same as the local hotspot.) </p><p>Does my feeling make any sense at all, or am I dead wrong?</p><p>If it is not a bug, then where should i suggest to add automatic channel reconfiguration fot the OpenWRT SSID?</p>									</div>

					<p>You have a single radio, and thus a single channel.&nbsp; Indeed, as some one pointed out a single config for the radio.&nbsp; The only difference is STA/client or AP and security.&nbsp; See this also <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59329">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59329</a></p><p>I actually did read this yesterday and spent some time looking into things, but could not craft a worthy reply at the time.</p><p>The &quot;Travel Router&quot; as built to day is a shrunk evolution of a router.&nbsp; (less Ethernet ports, smaller box, 5v).&nbsp; There is no evolution in the hardware or software to actually fit the use.&nbsp; Even real routers have the radio issue.&nbsp; Look at bridging and the need for relayd.&nbsp; Broadcom is about the only one that can do this, but the real solution is independent radios, so the two sides can be independent (channels and settings).&nbsp; There also is a need for GB with dual Ethernet (why should it be slow), at least 2 USB (wireless, 4G, camera, USB data, etc), and at least one or 2 programmable buttons (to many options).&nbsp; I do not care if its as small as the 6416 or this.&nbsp; I also need a battery, or it&#039;s just <strong>not</strong> a &quot;Travel Router&quot; (it&#039;s lots of other good things).&nbsp; The vendors market these as travel routers, but really treat them as media sharing devices if you look at the apps.&nbsp; Sure they have apps, but none do the single thing (well) everyone needs to do when they turn it on.&nbsp; Connect.&nbsp; I have a 15 minute window to use my phone or tablet.&nbsp; I do not want to spend 2 -3 minutes setting it up and again tearing it down.&nbsp; Power on, select, go, power off. Done.&nbsp; Once you go to Open-WRT, it gets worse.&nbsp; Gl.inet has about the only usable software solution, but they do not seem interested in adding a battery (proposed to alfie along with dual radios)</p><p>So far I have a technical solution, but not a practical one and I am not using it.</p>									</div>

					<p>yes the single channel like I expected. </p><p>but is this actually the cause of loosing the preconfigured OpenWRT SSID as soon as you add a Master SSID?&nbsp; Because that really sux... hehehe Specially when you dont have a Cat5 cable or USB TTL in your pocket :-)</p><p>Now i see the whole issue you had with having to do way to many steps to reconfigure the thing. And i agree it&#039;s not really practical in a travel scenario.&nbsp; &nbsp;It really would help if the client SSID&#039;s nicely followed the masters channel instead of completely dropping off the map.&nbsp; </p><p>But i&#039;m not sure if it is a bug. or just something that still is under construction.&nbsp; </p><p>If it is under construction, then i come back to my double router idea (the picture i showed a few days ago of the DIR-505 + NEXX linked together)</p><p>Then the DIR-505 can deal with the WAN config this is what to reconfigure at new locations.<br />And the NEXX just routes from WAN to LAN+WLAN and never has to be changed.</p><p>Ok it is a bit hackish... but it saves a lot of config stuff.. in your case it would consume also double the battery power. so that&#039;s another thing but you also have dual core hehehe,&nbsp; </p><p>Well thats how I would do it until there is a more easy way to do this within OpenWRT itself.<br />I&#039;ll have to draw a diagram of what i have in mind. I think it is capable of many nice things that just 1 box cannot do. </p><p>When you need to upgrade the firewall you can do that offline...&nbsp; When the new one is ready, unplug the old, an plugin the new.&nbsp; etc.</p><p>And you can make a pluggable config.</p><p>Make mini boxes <br />- Firewall<br />- HTTP Server<br />- POP Server<br />- TOR Router</p><p>Stick it all to the cold wall of the house with Velcro. <br />A Powered USB HUB with 4Ampere PSU.<br />A decentralised MINI home appliance.</p><p>And when the NSA want to hack your mailserver then they just need A LOT of patience.&nbsp; And the extra load will stand out. </p><p>Fast enough to send emails, slow enough to annoy hackers?&nbsp; not sure.. <br />You even could add a temperature sensor on each SoC, if it gets too hot then power it down for 10 minutes....&nbsp; <br />Then a hacker would have to tip-toe his way in.</p><p>Not sure though if this is at all practical for day to day use.</p>									</div>

					<p>@RangerZ <br />why do you neeed a battery dude.. its not like your in the middle of nowhere with no electrical wires around<br />even in the middleof the space you have juice from the device your using.. <br />id be more worried couse they use micro-B instead of mini-B for power..</p>									</div>

					<p>@frietpan - I do not think it&#039;s a bug and I do not think its under construction.&nbsp; The entire scenario is limited by the &quot;single radio means single channel&quot;.&nbsp; </p><p>If I set a LAN AP on channel 6, and configure my PC to connect to it, the PC saves the connection parameters including CH6.&nbsp; If I then use the SCAN to get an AP for the Client, and the AP is on channel 1, I think the only choices are 1) abort or 2) drop the connection on the AP side to the PC.</p><p>We are back to 2 radios.&nbsp; I just wish I had 2 USB ports so I could also have a USB drive in addition to my EdiMAX.</p>									</div>

					<p>So many people so many ways to use hardware.&nbsp; When on the road it&#039;s sure a pain to have to many &#039;stuff&#039; to keep track of.</p><p>back to the single radio single channel. <br />I do think there is one addition that could improve OpenWRT on this topic.</p><p>Now the preconfigured client is deleted when a master is added that is on a DIFFERENT channel.<br />This potentially can lead to a lock-out When you don&#039;t have a CAT cable at hand and rely 100% on wifi.</p><p>What I&#039;d like to see is something like this: </p><p>Lets say SSID OpenWRT Master is on channel1<br />You then scan for a local accespoint and connect to it.<br />This Client then turns out to be on lets say channel 6.&nbsp; (so the OpenWRT SSID gets deleted)<br />But if OpenWRT would RECONFIGURE the OpenWRT SSID from channel 1 to the Client&#039;s channel 6 then such a lockout should be prevented. </p><p>And a single radio would then be enough...</p><p>Or is there more at play under the hood that I&#039;m not aware of?</p><p>But who can build this functionality?
