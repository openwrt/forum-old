					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am interested in doing some work on the usb/ip module in OpenWRT, and I want to set up a build system to support this. My plan is to install everything needed on a machine dedicated exclusively to building OpenWRT (actually to a new hard drive in an existing machine). </p><p>The wiki contains some instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> </p><p>Are these instructions appropriate and reasonably up-to-date for setting up a build system on my host? Are there other resources I should read before commencing?</p><p>If I am generally on the right track, I have one other question: </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Debian seems to be the first choice for an OS, but I&#039;ve got more time on Ubuntu - how important is this? </p><p>Thank you </p><p>P.S. there does not seem to be a link on the how-to wki page (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/start</a>) to the OpenWRT build system installation instructions (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence ). Consequently, the build system instructions may be overlooked.</p>									</div>

					<p>So far, things have gone well. I&#039;m submitting this post to provide feedback on the instructions here, and to ask for some advice: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> </p><p>I.&nbsp; I encountered an issue in Step 3:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds install -a</code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; threw a build dependency: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Build dependency: Please install GNU &#039;awk&#039;</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>I chose the following option: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gawk</code></pre></div><p>That seemed to make it happy, it completed the process with no further complaints: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Installing all packages from feed packages.

					<p>Well, for instance, with a Gl.inet with stock openWrt firmware downloaded, these are the packages I have installed in one instance:</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install nano picocom kmod-usb-serial kmod-usb-serial-pl2303 kmod-usb-serial-ch341 kmod-usb-serial-cp210x<br />opkg install coreutils-stty lua luasocket wireless-tools ser2net usbutils<br />opkg install kmod-usb-storage block-mount kmod-scsi-generic kmod-nls-cp437 kmod-nls-iso8859-1 kmod-fs-vfat kmod-fs-ext4</p><p>To build your own firmware, you would find these packages in &quot;menuconfig&quot; and check them. You also select the architecture in menuconfig. I would be sure to select the option to save the menuconfig setting to a file.</p><p>List of available packages is here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/packages/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … /packages/</a></p><p>From there go up one level and you can look at base, luci, management, packages, routing, telephony.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 12 Oct 2015, 15:09)</p>

					<p>To complement the previous answers:<br />both &quot;make manuconfig&quot; and &quot;make defconfig&quot; run &quot;make prereq&quot; in order to check that your build host has all the needed packages installed at the host. So, it is enough to run one of them. Typical lists of the needed packages can be found at: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence#examples_of_package_installations">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build … tallations</a></p><p>&quot;make menuconfig&quot; also runs commands matching &quot;make defconfig&quot; as part of its process. So, running make menuconfig should be enough.</p><p>Your router defines the &quot;architecture&quot; as it has a certain type of processor etc. Check the Openwrt wiki page for your router. E.g I have WNDR3700, so I need ar71xx as the architecture. Go to make menuconfig, select first the architeture and then the correct router from the device list. That sets all the needed default packages needed for the router.</p><p>And V=99 is deprecated (since some 2 years), although it still works. Current option is V=s</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s perfect - thank you both. Unfortunately, I won&#039;t be able to try these hints until I return from my un-scheduled travel, but I&#039;ll follow up then.</p>									</div>
