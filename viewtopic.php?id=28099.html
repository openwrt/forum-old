					<p>I finally managed to set up a working music system!&nbsp; Actually, I have a system which still works, running Kamikaze r8480, but that setup&#039;s more limited than my new one, so...</p><p>The target system is:<br />A small box which connects via wires to my stereo system, and via wifi to my network, which includes a Linux system with my MP3 collection. Thus, this is a *client* of my existing wifi access point.</p><p>FIRST, a few assumptions: I&#039;m using Netgear WGT634U because when I bought a few of them, they were relatively inexpensive, and almost alone in offering both WiFi and USB.&nbsp; Newer routers have both - feel free to send me some hardware to test! :-)&nbsp; At any rate, they&#039;re a known unit, so I&#039;ll assume you already have Backfire running on one, with wifi running.&nbsp; I&#039;m grateful for the builds on <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc4/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … /brcm47xx/</a></p><p>SECOND assumption: I resisted as long as I could, but I finally gave in and plugged a USB hub into the WGT634U, so that I could have a USB audio device and a thumb drive.&nbsp; This actually resulted in...</p><p>THIRD assumption: Much of this could have been done with an extroot system, but I wanted something simpler. With this setup, I can boot with nothing plugged into USB and get a &quot;normal&quot; router, or I can plug in my thumb drive and get a customized setup.&nbsp; See how this becomes a flexible system?</p><p>Here&#039;s where we start getting specific.</p><p>On the basic system, install some necessary packages:<br />kmod-usb-core<br />kmod-usb2<br />kmod-nls-base<br />kmod-fs-ext2<br />kmod-scsi-core<br />kmod-usb-storage<br />block-mount<br />kmod-fuse<br />ldconfig</p><p>Next, create a USB thumb drive with one partition, and create an ext2 file system on it.&nbsp; Instructions for doing so are abundant, so I&#039;ll skip them here.&nbsp; (As a beginner, I used to hate it when people said that!) By the way, I would have preferred to have a vfat file system on the USB drive, so I could also use it on my Windows systems.&nbsp; However, we need symlinks, so...<br />- On my setup, this drive will be mounted as /dev/sda1; you should create several directories: ./bin ./etc ./lib ./music ./tmp ./usr ./var ./var/mpd<br />- Add this drive to /etc/config/fstab (I like to edit the config files, but you may prefer to use uci)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/config/fstab
config mount
        option target   /opt
        option device   /dev/sda1
        option fstype   ext2
        option options  rw
        option enabled  1</code></pre></div><p>Oh, and you&#039;ll want to &quot;mkdir /opt&quot; on the router! We&#039;re now prepared to reboot, and if all is well, /opt should be mounted and ready.</p><p>Add this to /etc/rc.local :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/rc.local
# If we mounted external storage, let it initialize itself
if [ -f /opt/etc/rc.local ] ; then
        sh /opt/etc/rc.local
fi</code></pre></div><p>We&#039;ll get to that /opt/etc/rc.local in a minute - first, let&#039;s install some packages on the USB drive.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;dest opt /opt&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/opkg.conf
opkg --dest opt install mpd kmod-usb-audio
opkg --dest opt install curlftpfs
ldconfig</code></pre></div><p>I had to add &quot;audio&quot; to /etc/group (555, arbitrary) to keep some portion of the audio programs happy.&nbsp; It was a small price to pay.<br />- At this point, I&#039;ve used only 13 MB of space on the USB drive - finally, I&#039;ve found a place where my 256 MB drive looks big!</p><p>Our music system will use /opt/etc/mpd.conf for a configuration file, with some specific file locations:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /opt/etc/mpd.conf
music_directory         &quot;/opt/music&quot;
playlist_directory      &quot;/opt/music&quot;
db_file                 &quot;/opt/var/mpd/mpd.db&quot;
log_file                &quot;/opt/var/mpd/mpd.log&quot;
error_file              &quot;/opt/var/mpd/mpd.error&quot;
pid_file                &quot;/opt/var/mpd/mpd.pid&quot;</code></pre></div><p>There&#039;s other info in that file that we&#039;ll get to later, but for now, keep in mind that &quot;/opt/var/mpd&quot; is on the USB drive, but &quot;/opt/music&quot; is on an external server.</p><p>Now let&#039;s create /opt/etc/rc.local - this does a few things in order to turn an ordinary router into a music box, so we&#039;ll break it up into parts.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /opt/etc/rc.local

### PART ONE
# Just in case...
PATH=/opt/bin:/opt/sbin:/opt/usr/bin:/opt/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin

### PART TWO
# Make this a client of home_net
uci set wireless.wifi0.channel=11
uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].network=wan
uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].mode=sta
uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].ssid=home_net
uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].encryption=none
uci delete wireless.@wifi-iface[0].key
uci commit wireless
# I *think* all we need is &quot;wifi up&quot;, but...
wifi down ; sleep 3 ; wifi up

### PART THREE
# Open up a few firewall ports (ssh, web, mpd)
iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables        -A input_wan      -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables        -A input_wan      -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 6600 -j ACCEPT
iptables        -A input_wan      -p tcp --dport 6600 -j ACCEPT

### PART FOUR
# It looks like it takes about 20sec to set up the home_net route
HNET_OK=&quot;&quot;
x=0; while [ $x -lt 10 ]; do
  rdate -s mp3serv &amp;&amp; HNET_OK=&quot;True&quot; &amp;&amp; break
  sleep 5
  : $((++x))
done

### PART FIVE
# curlftpfs looks in $HOME/.netrc for user:pass
#- so make sure it&#039;s set to the right value!
[ $HNET_OK ] &amp;&amp; HOME=/root curlftpfs -o nonempty ftp://mp3serv/ /opt/music
# - Thus we want two possible dB files (w/wo mp3serv),
#   but both stored locally!
( cd /opt/var/mpd
  [ $HNET_OK ] \
    &amp;&amp; cat mpd.db.mp3serv &gt; mpd.db \
    || cat mpd.db.local &gt; mpd.db
)
mpd /opt/etc/mpd.conf</code></pre></div><p><span class="bbu">Part One:</span><br />Some of the programs we&#039;re running here are in /opt (particularly &quot;mpd&quot;), so set the PATH accordingly.</p><p><span class="bbu">Part Two:</span><br />Use &quot;uci&quot; to set up this system as a client (mode=&quot;sta&quot;) of the home network. If you&#039;re more cautious than me, your network is encrypted, so you&#039;ll need to adjust these settings. (When I set up this system as a standalone<br />router, I added encryption and a key - for cleanliness, I&#039;m removing that key, but that might not be necessary.)</p><p><span class="bbu">Part Three:</span><br />Because the &quot;wan&quot; connection goes to our home network and not The Internet, we can safely open a few holes in the firewall: SSH, HTTP, and MPD.</p><p><span class="bbu">Part Four:</span><br />The &quot;wifi up&quot; command causes us to use DHCP to get an address from the home router.&nbsp; This is a double-purpose section - we&#039;ll poll the Linux box with the MP3 files (mp3serv) until that setup has finished, then we&#039;ll use it to set the date.</p><p><span class="bbu">Part Five:</span><br />This system uses &quot;curlftpfs&quot; to get files from the MP3 server. I&#039;ve used both NFS and Samba in other situations, but those were both more than I needed here - more CPU cycles, and more memory - so we&#039;ll make this simple. Again, because I have a simple and trusted network, I&#039;m not encrypting traffic on the curlftpfs connection - you might want to be more secure.<br />- I think read-write access is only needed in order to store playlists - if you don&#039;t need to create playlists, it might be better to mount this as a read-only system.<br />- Setting up /root/.netrc : <a href="http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net">http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net</a>/</p><p><span class="bbu">Part Five-point-One:</span><br />When I ran mpd on this new Backfire system and attempted to create the db_file, it just about killed the system!&nbsp; So, I installed mpd on the MP3 server, created a db_file, and copied that to the Backfire system (/opt/var/mpd/mpd.db).&nbsp; If the preceding sentence results in hours of effort and agony, you have my apologies.</p><p><span class="bbu">mpd configuration:</span><br />It took some tweaking to get the ALSA libraries to stop complaining when mpd started - it would run, but only after several error messages.&nbsp; One error was cured by adding &quot;audio&quot; to /etc/group (mentioned above); another required specifying some of the &quot;default&quot; values!<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /opt/etc/mod.conf (continued from above)
# Isn&#039;t this silly? We need to specify the mixer defaults! (mpd 0.15.0)
audio_output {
        type            &quot;alsa&quot;
        name            &quot;local alsa&quot;
        mixer_device    &quot;default&quot;
        mixer_control   &quot;PCM&quot;
}</code></pre></div><p><span class="bbu">Going Onward:</span><br />The basic system, without the USBdrive, can remain basic, and &quot;fancy&quot; packages can be installed on /opt - but there are occasional stumbling blocks. For example, any programs using &quot;ncurses&quot; will need this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ln -s /opt/usr/share/terminfo /usr/share/terminfo</code></pre></div><p>Another Issue:<br />My USB-audio device (the standard, and cheap, C-Media dongle) only works if it&#039;s plugged in at boot time.&nbsp; If I boot without it and plug it in later, it&#039;s not detected - is hotplug broken?</p><p>For MPD Debugging Help:<br /><a href="http://openlinksys.info/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=63&amp;thread_id=10642">http://openlinksys.info/forum/viewthrea … d_id=10642</a><br />- in Polish?! Anyway, many mpd debug hints</p>									</div>
