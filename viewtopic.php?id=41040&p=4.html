Don&#039;t see the option to browse for an update in the Chinese menu, and don&#039;t know if it is traditional or simplified Chinese--they say you can update the traditional menued 702 with english versions, so I&#039;m guessing simplified box.<br />I took apart the latest english version v3 file, extracted the lzma compressed main code and found the string sent out the serial port when the md5 sum is not correct. Looking at the code around that area I found the 0x10 bytes of md5 copied from the 0x4 position of the file header then that space is overwritten with CC 96 28 EE 8D FB 21 BB 3D EF 6C B5 9F 77 4C 07 (hum, that last number looks wrong, but the first four should find the correct sequence). There is a routine that , skipping the first byte, looks for 0x00 value and adds 2 to the location found and subtracts that from the value in the first word of the header--that seems to be number of bytes the md5 covers--looks to me that would be 0x142fc0-0x23 bytes. Now, it gets harder and I haven&#039;t figured it all out. Looks like md5 is computed and stored, but then a second routine is called and it does some calls to the md5 routine too--two times, with some other stuff done as well. Might need to emulate the code or run it on some other mips based device to see what is really happening. Whatever that extra stuff is, once it is all done there is just a mem compare step and based on that result either error message sent out serial port or header removed and file written to flash.</p></blockquote></div><p>decompressing TL-WA5210G firmware i can find this same string CC 96 28 EE 8D FB 21 BB 3D EF 6C B5 9F 77 4C 7C in unpacked file but replacing actual md5 string with this one and recalculating md5sum gives md5 other than original and the device won&#039;t accept modified firmware. </p><p>anyone knows how to update md5 correctly for this firmware?</p>									</div>
