					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve just got a Broadcom BCM43602 PCIe wireless adapter for my computer and then I&#039;ve attached it to my PC. Now I installed VMware ESXi 6.0 on the PC and then created an virtual machine with offical OpenWrt 15.05 x86 generic image downloaded from openwrt&#039;s offical website. Everything works fine except this Broadcom wireless adapter, it seems doesn&#039;t work at all!</p><p><strong>The problem is, when I access LuCI interface, on the &quot;Wifi&quot; section, no matter how I&#039;ve tried to click the &quot;Enable&quot; or &quot;Disable&quot;, or tried to modify the settings in many different ways, it always shows me &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot;.</strong></p><p><strong><br />I&#039;ve also tried using some thrid-party broadcom firmware where I&#039;ve found on some Chinese online forums. </strong></p><p><strong>For example, currently I&#039;m using this one: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIfEsuWu9wTNHhOeFFmazU1Mmc/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIfEs … sp=sharing</a></strong></p><p><strong>Also, if I use it to connect some other wireless APs as client mode, it seems working, so I think I may using the&nbsp; right driver or firmware. But why it cannot be enabled as AP mode? </strong></p><br /><br /><br /><p>So here is some logs:</p><p> --- dmesg log ---</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# dmesg | grep brcm

You will need firmware. The firmware you use (from the archive) appears to be ok, but the nvram isn&#039;t. I would not use that txt file unless you know for 100% sure that it belongs to the device you have. And I&#039;m not talking about it being a 43602. The nvram file is board specific and differs per manufacturer, that is why it is not being published. The 43602 firmware can be found in the linux firmware repository. The repository does have two firwmares. One for AP and one for STA. Though the sta version will also work in AP mode, but not as optimized. Vice versa is also true, the AP version will work in STA mode, but has limited features in that case. So you can choose whatever you prefer. <br />Openwrt uses the 43602 through the r8000 and it has been tested and verified working. There is still some work in progress to get it better, but getting the 43602 to work with OpenWrt should definately be possible. <br />So start of with firmware from the linux firmware repository and dont use a nvram file initially. Then get the module loaded with debug enabled. It means that you have to enabled debugging in the openwrt config and you&#039;ll somehow have to get the brcmfmac loaded with &quot;debug=0x1fffff&quot; or modify the brcmfmac source code to have this debug setting as default. Do note; openwrt uses backports. This means that it will use the brcmfmac from the backport and not the one which is default in the kernel. </p><p>What I do not know is if the image you use has brcmfmac enabled/built in. My guess is that it hasn&#039;t. So you&#039;ll have to download the source and build your own image (after having it configured for brcmfmac support).</p><p>Where did your 43602 come from? Perhaps if you tell me the source I can tell whether you&#039;ll need a nvram file or not.</p>									</div>

You will need firmware. The firmware you use (from the archive) appears to be ok, but the nvram isn&#039;t. I would not use that txt file unless you know for 100% sure that it belongs to the device you have. And I&#039;m not talking about it being a 43602. The nvram file is board specific and differs per manufacturer, that is why it is not being published. The 43602 firmware can be found in the linux firmware repository. The repository does have two firwmares. One for AP and one for STA. Though the sta version will also work in AP mode, but not as optimized. Vice versa is also true, the AP version will work in STA mode, but has limited features in that case. So you can choose whatever you prefer. <br />Openwrt uses the 43602 through the r8000 and it has been tested and verified working. There is still some work in progress to get it better, but getting the 43602 to work with OpenWrt should definately be possible. <br />So start of with firmware from the linux firmware repository and dont use a nvram file initially. Then get the module loaded with debug enabled. It means that you have to enabled debugging in the openwrt config and you&#039;ll somehow have to get the brcmfmac loaded with &quot;debug=0x1fffff&quot; or modify the brcmfmac source code to have this debug setting as default. Do note; openwrt uses backports. This means that it will use the brcmfmac from the backport and not the one which is default in the kernel. </p><p>What I do not know is if the image you use has brcmfmac enabled/built in. My guess is that it hasn&#039;t. So you&#039;ll have to download the source and build your own image (after having it configured for brcmfmac support).</p><p>Where did your 43602 come from? Perhaps if you tell me the source I can tell whether you&#039;ll need a nvram file or not.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here is a photo I&#039;ve taken for my wireless adapter: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIfEsuWu9wTeGNzQUxEaTllU2s/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIfEs … sp=sharing</a></p><p>BTW I&#039;ve changed &quot;device ID&quot; and MAC address in the text configuration file, but it still doesn&#039;t work.

The device is not an RSDB device (Real Simultaneous Dual Band), but you can use 2.4G and 5G in &quot;parallel&quot; by time slicing using a feature called VSDB, but that has obviously limited possibilities. You can for example be a client in 2.4 and have a p2p go in the 5g. But you can for example not have an AP in 2.4g and sta in 5g. The reason is that sta can &quot;time-slicing&quot; using powersave, and p2p can also do that using dedicated methods, but AP can&#039;t. In that case you&#039;ll not transmit/receive at the same time in 2.4 and 5. but you will a short while on one frequency and then a short period on the other frequency.</p>									</div>
