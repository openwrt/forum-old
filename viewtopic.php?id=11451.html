					<p>Getting Kamikaze installed is not that difficult, and it only takes a little editing to make it perform basic duties as home router. The following will hopefully be able to help a new-commer to OpenWrt Kamikaze with the setup of a basic functional system.</p><p>This howto is based on the use of a Linksys WRT54G version 3.1, which is fully supported by OpenWrt Kamikaze - if you have another device please check <a href="http://toh.openwrt.org">http://toh.openwrt.org</a> to see if it is supported. It is assumend that the WRT has either the original firmware installed, or as in this case an older version of OpenWrt White Russian with the original OpenWrt webif. The following process consists of three parts:</p><p>1. Installation<br />2. Gettting access<br />3. Configuration</p><br /><p>######################</p><br /><p>1. Installation</p><p>There are several ways to install Kamikaze, but this will only cover the very basic procedure based on using the firmware upgrade function of the webinterface (webif). <br />Thsi means in praxis, that all which is needed to be done is to download the precompiled Kamikaze image and then simply upgrade the device.<br />Kamikaze supports a rather large number of different platforms (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms">https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms</a>) so it is required to download the correct image from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.06/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.06/</a> <br />In the case of the WRT54G the correct image recides in the brcm-2.4/ directory - in this directory the correct file to download would have the name: openwrt-wrt54g-2.4-squashfs.bin</p><p>It should be noted that there are two different brcm directories (brcm-2.4/ and brcm47xx-2.6) in the Kamikaze directory - these refer to images based on either 2.4 or 2.6 kernel. But, the 2.6 kernel does presently not support broadcom wireless, and installing the 2.6 image would leave the wireless interface of the WRT54G non-functional.</p><p>When the correct image is downloaded, then it is just needed to login to the router (enter the ip-adress of your router in a browser and press return) followed by pointing the firmware upgrade function at the correct image and the pressing of the &#039;upgrade button&#039;. <br />*It is always recommended to use a cable connection between router and pc/laptop. The wireless connection can fluctuate and this might result in loss of data during the transfer, which again would leave the router with a non-functional system after reboot.</p><br /><p>######################</p><br /><p>2. Getting access</p><p>Getting the first access to the new Kamikaze system requires that you login to the router via telnet (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet</a>) and set a new login password (on windows you would need to install something like Putty (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>). The default ip-adress of the router is 192.168.1.1, so you would have to check that your pc/laptop has acquired a correct corresponding ip-adress from the router (which should be the case if you&#039;r still connected via ethernet cable). If the ip-adress is not correct, then try to force a re-new of the ip-adress.</p><p>The complete login and password setting procedure looks like this --&gt;</p><p>----</p><p>telnet 192.168.1.1<br />Trying 192.168.1.1...<br />Connected to 192.168.1.1.<br />Escape character is &#039;^]&#039;.<br /> === IMPORTANT ============================<br />&nbsp; Use &#039;passwd&#039; to set your login password<br />&nbsp; this will disable telnet and enable SSH<br /> ------------------------------------------</p><br /><p>BusyBox v1.4.2 (2007-06-01 15:48:27 CEST) Built-in shell (ash)<br />Enter &#039;help&#039; for a list of built-in commands.</p><p>&nbsp; _______&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|.-----.-----.-----.|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |.----.|&nbsp; |_<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; _&nbsp; |&nbsp; -__|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; ||&nbsp; &nbsp;_||&nbsp; &nbsp;_|<br /> |_______||&nbsp; &nbsp;__|_____|__|__||________||__|&nbsp; |____|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__| W I R E L E S S&nbsp; &nbsp;F R E E D O M<br /> KAMIKAZE (7.06) -----------------------------------<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz Vodka&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shake well with ice and strain<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz Triple sec&nbsp; mixture into 10 shot glasses.<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz lime juice&nbsp; Salute!<br /> ---------------------------------------------------<br />root@OpenWrt:/# passwd<br />Changing password for root<br />New password:<br />Retype password:<br />Password for root changed by root<br />root@OpenWrt:/# </p><p>----</p><p>Hereafter it is needed to logout, to close the telnet connection (which is insecure), and instead use the ssh service for the future (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell</a>).

The list of known hosts is a small text file, and should you encounter problems with &#039;fingerprints&#039; belonging to devices with similar ip-adresses (like: 192.168.1.1) then its a simple task to solve login problems with editing the file by simply removing the entry which results in problems.</p><br /><p>######################</p><br /><p>3. Configuration</p><p>The default configuration of Kamikaze differs at least in two significant aspects:</p><p>1. There is no build-in webinterface.<br />2. The wireless interface is disabled.</p><p>This means that the user has to learn how to edit &quot;manually&quot; and in this way enable the wireless interface. The files which needs to be edited recide in the /etc/config directory - and they are named &#039;network&#039; and &#039;wireless&#039;</p><p>The following will first show how to find the correct files on the Kamikaze system and then how to edit the same files (beginning with login to the system and showing the steps needed + what the content of the different directories are) --&gt;</p><p>----</p><p>ssh root@192.168.33.1<br />root@192.168.33.1&#039;s password: </p><br /><p>BusyBox v1.4.2 (2007-06-01 15:48:27 CEST) Built-in shell (ash)<br />Enter &#039;help&#039; for a list of built-in commands.</p><p>&nbsp; _______&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|.-----.-----.-----.|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |.----.|&nbsp; |_<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; _&nbsp; |&nbsp; -__|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; ||&nbsp; &nbsp;_||&nbsp; &nbsp;_|<br /> |_______||&nbsp; &nbsp;__|_____|__|__||________||__|&nbsp; |____|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__| W I R E L E S S&nbsp; &nbsp;F R E E D O M<br /> KAMIKAZE (7.06) -----------------------------------<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz Vodka&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shake well with ice and strain<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz Triple sec&nbsp; mixture into 10 shot glasses.<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz lime juice&nbsp; Salute!<br /> ---------------------------------------------------<br />root@OpenWrt:~# <br />root@OpenWrt:~# pwd<br />/tmp</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# ls<br />dhcp.leases&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;log&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resolv.conf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;run<br />lock&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; preinit.log&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resolv.conf.auto&nbsp; spool</p><br /><p>----</p><p>As you can see the default &quot;login position&quot; is in the /tmp directory of the system - the files which needs to be edited are, as mentioned above, in /etc/config so you will need to change directory --&gt;</p><p>----</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cd /etc/</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc# ls<br />banner&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;firewall.user&nbsp; &nbsp; inittab&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passwd-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rc.common<br />config&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;functions.sh&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ipkg.conf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ppp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rc.d<br />crontabs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;group&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; modules.d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; preinit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resolv.conf<br />diag.sh&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hosts&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mtab&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;preinit.arch&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shells<br />dnsmasq.conf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hotplug.d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; openwrt_version&nbsp; profile&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sysctl.conf<br />dropbear&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;init.d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;passwd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;protocols&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uci-defaults</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc# cd config/</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# ls<br />dhcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dropbear&nbsp; firewall&nbsp; network&nbsp; &nbsp;system&nbsp; &nbsp; wireless</p><p>----</p><p>The default editor on Kamikaze is &#039;vi&#039;.

					<p>I think your error message is pretty plain. You linux kernel does not run pppoe. As you said you have kamikaze 7.06 kernel 2.6.19.2 NOT kernel 2.4! There are two versions, 2.6 apparently does not have working pppoe (according to the message you got) and ALSO does not have working wireless. You should download the 2.4 package of 7.07 and install that.</p><p>In terms of the other quote... what context was that? I can pretty much tell you that the gateway and dns settings you reference ARE NOT anything to do with pppoe.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>napierzaza</strong> on 2 Aug 2007, 05:00)</p>

					<p>This post shows how to install Kamikaze from a version which already has webif available.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched, but it&#039;s very hard to be comprehensive, and I haven&#039;t seen a howto on installing to a WRT54G (v2.2) which has original Linksys software.&nbsp; If there is such a document, could someone point to it?</p><p>Also the opening date on this post is June of 2007.
