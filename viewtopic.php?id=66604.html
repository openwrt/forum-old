					<p>Heyo!</p><p>I&#039;m having trouble with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-NBG6616-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin located in <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … x/generic/</a> when I try to flash my NBG6616.</p><p>It&#039;s running the default OpenWRT out of the box with whatever additions they made, but I&#039;d like to upgrade it so I can use opkg, installing OpenVPN and so on.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@NBG6616:/etc# cat /etc/openwrt_release

					<p>there seems to be an issue with the newest designated driver OpenWRT version that you noted above. I have the same problem. I installed/updated OpenWRT without any problems several times on my NBG6616 with snapshots from April to July 2016. The newest snapshot from 2. August bricks my router and I have to tftp the original firmware. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t keep a old version from July that worked. So we will have to wait for a working snapshot...</p>									</div>
