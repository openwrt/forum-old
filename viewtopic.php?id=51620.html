					<p>Assuming by &quot;ROM&quot; you mean flash memory: There are many models with 16 MB flash, you just didn&#039;t look hard enough. If you want more, aside from some rather obscure and hard to come by machines some of the most recent Netgears (WNDR4300, newer revisions of WNDR3700) come with 128 MB, and I believe some Mikrotik routerboards, too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 14 Jul 2014, 23:09)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I have a couple of TP-Link 4900 v1.3 and they run pretty well. Except the one but statet in the according thread (don&#039;t use 300MBit on 2.4GHz), which doesn&#039;t bother me at all, that is a pretty awesom device.</p><p>I just bought two additional ones of this on &quot;Amazon Warehouse&quot; for 62€. Warehouse is Amazons &quot;somebody bought one and returned it within 30 days&quot; thigny.</p><p>The TP-Link 4900 doesn&#039;t have &quot;lots of memory&quot;, it only has 16MB flash. But it has 128MB RAM and runs a nice strong PPC 800MHz freescale.</p><p>Make sure to get the v1.x, the v2.x has only 8MB.</p><p>I bought one 4900 about half a year ago. It has insanely bright bleu LEDs, wich required me to put some stripes of dark tape on it in order to not get insane as soon as the sun goes down.<br />The other 4900s I just bought last week have darker gree LEDs. They are much better.</p><p>And ontop of that, you can always use an USB stick to increase your memory. There are things like the Kingston Micro DTMCK 64GB for 25€. This makes nearly every router with enough CPU and RAM a nice candidate, as soon as it has an USB port. Depending on the actual amount of memory you are searching, this might be an option, too.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a></p><br /><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm. I would guess that extroot is too complicated for most of the users - and it blocks the USB-port, so you have to buy a unit with more USB or you have to use a hub (which needs another power supply).<br />And why someone should buy a unit with broken wifi (you stated <em>&quot;don&#039;t use 300MBit on 2.4GHz&quot;</em>) if there are alternatives which are working!?</p>									</div>

					<p>Like I said: Being not able to use 40MHz channels in 2.4GHz doesn&#039;t bother me much because there isn&#039;t enough room in my local environment anyway, so even stock routers usually fall back to 20MHz when being allowed to &quot;use 40MHz when possible&quot; here. And ontop of that: That&#039;s not a general issue of this particular device but only currenlty broken in latest trunk. So, speaking as a software developer, I wouldn&#039;t go for a different device just because of a minor software glitch.</p><p>And for the extroot thingy: That heavily depends on who wants to achieve what. You&#039;re right, those user who just put OpenWRT on stock routers, install LuCI and start clicking won&#039;t be happy with that. But slthomason didn&#039;t say he was one of those. He didn&#039;t even say what for he&#039;s looking for a router. Maybe he doesn&#039;t even need extroot but just a large data partition somewhere to put some files in. I don&#039;t see any reason to not tell him about all available storage options.</p><p>At the end of the day it&#039;s his decision, and I guess he&#039;s capable of deciding if it&#039;s worth using one USB port and an additional amount of 25 bugs in order to get 4000 times the minimum memory he requested.</p><p>So I don&#039;t see any reason to not tell him any of this information just because there might be the chance he could make a personal decsion against that.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
