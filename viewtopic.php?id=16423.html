					<p>Hi.... I am not an expert on this but, on the wrt devices there is something like bootwait... when is this disable it&#039;s hard to reflash the router.

					<p>Could someone please explain how did you get to the Bootbase console on your routers without using JTAG cable? As far as I know both P334 and P335 (from your post it is not quite clear which one you used) only have 4 Ethernet ports and 1 WAN port. Did you somehow got to the console only using some of the Ethernet ports? Could you explain in some detail how did you do that? I would also like to replace original firmware from my Zyxel P335U but I&#039;m too lazy to bother with JTAG cables etc.</p><p>Best regards and thanks in advance,<br />Stefan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shtef</strong> on 7 Jan 2009, 21:05)</p>

					<p>RoundSparrow, I appreciate your answer but I don&#039;t think that you understood the issue here.<br />Where do you plug in the serial cable when there is no serial port on a device? None of these P334 or P335 devices have a serial port, all they have are Ethernet ports (well P335&#039;s have USP port also).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shtef</strong> on 7 Jan 2009, 23:30)</p>

					<p>Thanks RoundSparrow, I think I got it. From what I have read on the wiki page for these devices, I thought that J1 header would be the JTAG thingy but I guess I was wrong. So I think I&#039;ll try this with some Nokia cables.<br />I opened my router and took a hi-res picture of this board. Header in question is marked as J2, but I guess that&#039;s the same thing, right?</p><p><a href="http://img509.imageshack.us/my.php?image=img0564ric2.jpg"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/3341/img0564ric2.th.jpg" alt="http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/3341/img0564ric2.th.jpg" /></span></a></p>									</div>
