					<p>Hi mohnkhan!!!</p><p>Thanks for your reply!!!</p><p>- My problem is simple (i think), i have a router where i&#039;ve installed the wrtopen firmware. Ok<br />- I configured my router to make my lan working, and of course, i have my internet connection working properly. Ok<br />- Now, my desire is to make a captive portal using the router that i&#039;ve installed with the wrtopen firmware. Ok???</p><p>- The problem now is: I not found any manual to implement the captive portal (wifidog in that case) in my router.. Yesssss... I know there is a official page of wifidog, but with my noob condition i can&#039;t understand how to configure that portal.</p><p>The only think i readed that is useful is that i need to edit a file called wifidog.conf (it&#039;s supossed this filed is &quot;autoexplained&quot;) but the problem es I CAN&#039;T FIND THAT FILE!!!! ;-) </p><p>I think this manual on wifidog page is for implement wifidog in a Linux based PC, not in wrt router... Is possible is the biggest problem, i can&#039;t find some information about implement captive portal only with a router. Maybe i&#039;m confused and i need a pc + router to make that captive portal. I thougth the only think i need is a router, but at this moment i&#039;m not sure on this.</p><br /><p>Resuming: I have the router, i have the wifidog package installed (i&#039;ve installed it from software menu inside the router), i&#039;ve started the service of wifidog, but..... I can&#039;t continue to make the captive portal because there is no manual explaining how to do it for NOOBSSS, and there is no kindly person that want to lose 5 minutes of her life to explain me if i need something more to implement the portal, or only the router.... and if i only need the router how to configure the captive portal with wifidog.</p><br /><p>Thanks for your patience and excuse my very, very bad english... I&#039;m from Spain.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>there are other captiveportals, but the question is, what do you want to do?<br />do you need a portal with authentication, accounting,... or do you just want to redirect your user to a splashscreen, with infos about you and where they have to accept your terms of use? if you want to achieve this you could use nodogsplash, or nocatsplash, on the router itself. But you will need to edit configfiles, too. I used nodogsplash and its quite easy to configure. <br />for a more complex setup you will probably need wifidog or chillispot and another (linux-)machine with radiusserver, database,...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi eleon216..</p><p>Thanks for info.</p><p>I understand that if i want to make accounts i need an auth server. I understand that this server is not possible to implement in the same router, i need a pc to implement the auth server to make the accounts, etc...</p><p>My purpose is to control the wifi connections to my wifi router and control the time that user is connected to network. For example, if a user wants to connect 1 hour to internet i want to assing a username and password and user can now connect to internet with my wifi connection. When a hour pass i need that internet connections close to that user.</p><p>I not understand the use of the program you tell me &quot;nodogsplash&quot;. What&#039;s the purpose of showing the splash screen but not limit the internet connection time to the user? ¿?</p><p>What program you recomend me wifidog or chillispot? I can see both programs are in the openwrt repository inside the router webpage configuration.</p><p>I suppose the authserver i need to install must be installed in other pc, not in the router, ¿sure?</p><p>Thanks another time for your time and answers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello evilforces,<br />i have installed wifidog on my WRT54G flashed with openwrt.<br />And you suppose well, you have to setup an authentification server in a pc.<br />To access to wifidog.conf, use the telnet :<br />in windows, use cmd, then write &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot; (without &quot;&quot;)<br />then you are in the router, and it&#039;s like a linux distro, write &quot;cd /etc/&quot;<br />and &quot;vi wifidog.conf&quot;<br />i advise you to read doc vi, in order to edit the file.<br />Good Luck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>using telnet is a really bad advise, especially if you are planning to run a hotspot! <br />use telnet the first time, to set a password for the root-user and then connect through ssh (secure shell). if you are on windows get the program &quot;putty&quot; for ssh-connections </p><p>telnet without setting a password would mean everybody could connect to the CLI of your router, and would have superuser-rights. this is really a very very bad idea! And if you set a password, the telnet-daemon is disabled per default, so you have to use ssh and you really should.</p>									</div>

					<p>Personally, I would leave the captive portal business to yet another box, and let the wireless box do only the wireless.</p><p>I remember from using it a few years ago that m0n0wall had a very easy to configure captive portal with accounts and users and accounting and the whole shebang. And it has a nice PHP web interface.</p><p>But if you only want to show people a warning and informational message nodogsplash is okay. But you have to use vi unimproved on a file.</p>									</div>
