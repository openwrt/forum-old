					<p>OK, that makes sense, I was just hopping something could be possible to do because the hwclock command is comming with the openwrt releases.</p><p>Anyway, I guess I&#039;ll have to rethink about my project. Let me share it with you:</p><p>Basically I have a distance sensor (HC-SR04) to measure the water level of a tank. This sensor is on the top of the tank and has one input (trigger) and an output (echo).<br />In order to know the water level, I measure the distance from the sensor to the water. And how can it measure the distance with this device? We have to put the trigger pin at &quot;1&quot; and the sensor will send an ultrasound &quot;ping&quot; that will be reflected in the object (in this case, the water). When the reflection (&quot;pong&quot;) reaches the sensor, the echo pin turns &quot;1&quot;.<br />Measuring the time between &quot;ping&quot; and &quot;pong&quot;, with some math and&nbsp; knowing the speed of sound (~340m/s) we can get an approximate distance.</p><p>Since the fonera router is not really reliable to measure time (multi tasking OS), I was thinking in somehow using the RTC to measure it, but since its not supported in OpenWRT, I have to come with other alternative.</p><p>An additional detail is that the sensor pins are connected to a PCF8574 (I2C port extender) and this may have impact on the measurement time. However, I&#039;m not able to quantify it in order to know if it should be considered in the calculations.</p><p>So, any suggestion on how to make this work?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I don&#039;t think the DS1307 would be a good part for your case. I would use a PCF8583, which is able to run as event counter. Additionally a RS-Flip-Flop and a timer.<br />What you would do is connect the trigger pin of the PCF8574 to the S-input of the flip-flop, as well as to the Trig pin of the HC-SR04. The echo pin needs to be connected to the R-input of the flip-flop. So this way, you would get a high-output on the flip-flop for the duration of the sonic. Now connect a timer (555) with a pulse-time of 58 µs that runs when the output of the flip-flop is high. Feed the output of the timer into the OSI of the PCF8583 and it will count your distance in cm (since that should work with 6 decimal digits, you could theoretically measure up to 10 km :-)<br />But, you need to communicate to the PCF8583 directly over I2C (using i2c-get/i2c-set or fopen/fread/fwrite), I haven&#039;t found event timer support in the kernel, yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>That basically looks pretty good for a start. Now I thought, it might be better to let the 555 run all the time (since I don&#039;t know if it needs some time to power-up) and connect its output to one of the free inputs of the 7400. On the other NAND input, you connect your RS-flip flop output (Q or the inverted Q). So the timer will always put logical 0 and 1 on the NAND input, but only when the RS-part gets logical 1, the timer signal gets (inverted) out - into the PCF8583 OSCI. No need for the resistor and transistor - TTL logic is simple plug and play ;-)<br />For fine-tuning you might consider to place a monoflop between the PCF8574 and the 7400 (and maybe the HC-SR04), so you just have a short pulse to trigger the (I would call it) Set-input of the RS. Otherwise, after the echo has been received, R changes from 1 to 0, but if S is still 1, it will continue to pass-through the timer ticks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, of course you can use any I2C-device on openwrt, but my definition of support is, that a kernel driver (which exists for the ds1307) is implemented. And this is not the case at the moment. So, you can either use some script to sync your router clock to your ds1307, or you could build your own image and with the additional step of running &#039;make kernel_menuconfig&#039; enable rtc and ds1307 support in the kernel.<br />About current progress: I&#039;ve seen a patch recently in the mailing list, to enable rtc for the ar71xx-platform, but so far it hasn&#039;t been applied to trunk. If it ever gets applied, the following I2C-rtc-chips would be supported: ds1672, isl1208, pcf8563, pt7c4338.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, if you like to build your own firmware image, you could do a very simple hack: enter the directory target/linux/generic and edit the config-3.xx file corresponding to your desired kernel version (or all, if you are not sure). Search for the line with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># CONFIG_RTC_CLASS is not set</code></pre></div><p>and change it to<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CONFIG_RTC_CLASS=y</code></pre></div><p>And while you are at it, do the same with CONFIG_RTC_DRV_DS1307. Thus, you will have those two modules already in the kernel. Then continue &quot;make menuconfig&quot; where you select the packages you need (including the i2c-driver! and hwclock) and finally issue &quot;make&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MBS</strong> on 23 Feb 2014, 13:28)</p>
