					<p>Here is a brief description on how to run backfire with the 2.6 kernel on the ASUS WL700gE. In the belief that this was a simple task, I recently bought this piece of hardware as a replacement for a slowly dying WL500gE. To my knowledge the WL700gE is the only 3 USB port, &lt; 20watt, HDD-router, printer-, scanner-, http-, samba-, and UPnP-server available. Trying to squeeze all these expectations in to 1,8MB of flash was therefore a rather disappointing experience.</p><p>After trawling the internet for a while I went for the kexec approach. In short this implies compiling a small flash image (kexec kernel), that basically preforms the same tasks as a bios. Once installed the router can boot a second kernel from a USB/HDD drive, and you never need to change the flash image. </p><p>This guide describes how to build a kexec image and load a second kernel image from a ext2 formatted USB flash drive. It may also be possible to load a second image form the hard drive, but since I want my disk to spin down for long periods of time, I choose to place my root and swap partition on a USB drive. </p><p><strong>Use this HOWTO at your own risk!</strong></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - A working build system (I use Ubuntu 11.10) see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - 3-4 GB of available hard disk space to build (i.e. cross-compile) OpenWrt.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Basic knowledge on how to build the linux kernel.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - USB flash drive <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><strong>1. Build the kexec image </strong><br />(if you just want the image get it <a href="http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/3/21/3281530/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">here</a>)<br />Create build DIR and download source revision 27227 (the current revision produces to large an image)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mkdir ~/openwrt
cd openwrt
svn checkout --revision=27227 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire/ ./r27227
cd r27227</code></pre></div><p>Check dependencies, get a working config file and run make (this will take some time).<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make defconfig
wget http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/3/21/3281530/config_kexec
mv config_kexec .config
make menuconfig</code></pre></div><p>Add extra functions to your kexec image if required (extra functions take up space you don&#039;t have). If you want to boot a second image from the harddrive, disable all the USB modules, and add: &quot;Kernel modules&quot; -&gt; &quot;Block devices&quot; -&gt; &quot;*kmod-ide-core&quot;, &quot;*kmod-ide-aec62xx&quot;. (not tested). Else do nothing, save and exit. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make V=99 world
make kernel_menuconfig</code></pre></div><p>Select -&gt; &quot;Kernel type&quot; -&gt; &quot;*kexec system call&quot;, and select &quot;General setup&quot; ? &quot;* Support initial ramdisks compressed using LZMA and Built-in initramfs compression mode&quot; –&gt; &quot;*LZMA&quot;, save and exit.<br />Now you have to </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> nano -w build_dir/linux-brcm47xx/linux-2.6.32.27/arch/mips/kernel/machine_kexec.c</code></pre></div><p>Modify line 55 <br />from: &quot;kexec_start_address = image-&gt;start;&quot; <br />into: &quot;kexec_start_address = (unsigned long) phys_to_virt(image-&gt;start);&quot;</p><p>The kexec image will need to know where to find the second kernel image. This is specified in the /etc/rc.local, but since we can&#039;t modify files once in flash, the file must be modified now. The rc.local file supplied will load a second initramfs kernel image named &quot;openwrt-brcm47xx-vmlinux.elf&quot; from the root of a usb drive (ext2 formatted). The rc.local file must go in ~/openwrt/r27227/files/etc/ before &quot;make&quot;.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mkdir files &amp;&amp; cd files/ &amp;&amp; mkdir etc &amp;&amp; cd etc
wget http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/3/21/3281530/rc.local
cd ~/openwrt/r27227/
make V=99</code></pre></div><p>You should now have a 1,77MB .trx image in &quot;~/openwrt/r27227/bin/brcm47xx/&quot;.<br />If you want to boot the second kernel from the HDD, change rc.local accordingly before make.</p><p>If you don&#039;t want to spend time compiling your own kexec image just:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/3/21/3281530/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</code></pre></div><p>and flash. </p><p><strong>2. Flash the image to the router</strong></p><p>Connect your PC to a LAN port of the router. Power up the router while holding the ez-setup button until the &quot;Ready light&quot; stops flashing. The router now runs a tfpd server, IP: 192.168.1.1. <br />In order to connect to the router you must give your PC a static IP. On a Linux PC this is done by disabling Networkmanager and:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
sudo /sbin/route add -host 192.168.1.2 dev eth0</code></pre></div><p>Try to ping the router&#039;s IP to see if you are good to go.<br />Get &quot;tftp&quot; (if you don&#039;t have it already), CD into the directory of the kexec trx image and flash:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftp 192.168.1.1

tftp&gt; put openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</code></pre></div><p>Wait for 2 minutes and press the &quot;reset&quot; button on the router.

					<p>larmoe,&nbsp; these instructions look brilliant, I think even a noob like me could this working.&nbsp; I especially like your succinct description of the kexec approach, it hadn&#039;t dawned on me that you would never need to change the flash image again.&nbsp; And having the second kernel on usb instead of hdd - even better!</p><p>Now get this, a couple of days ago I noticed repeated hard drive activity from my WL700, I couldn&#039;t get to the web interface.&nbsp; Turns out it was stuck in a cycle of constant reboots.&nbsp; I cycled the power a few times, didn&#039;t help, pressed reset button, nope.&nbsp; I reflashed it with the Asus firmware restoration tool with the kfurge modified asus firmware and it still kept rebooting same as before.&nbsp; Flashed again with stock asus 1.7.8 and it seemed to be OK, so I upgraded to kfurge firmware via web interface and it went back to the same reboot loop.&nbsp; Then flashed the stock asus again and left it alone, it seemed OK.&nbsp; Next morning there were no lights on, it looked like it was powered off.&nbsp; I hoped maybe someone had accidentally pressed the power button.&nbsp; I restarted it, but in the afternoon it was off again.&nbsp; Flashed it a few more times, but now it always goes back to infinite reboot loop.</p><p>I have checked the power supply while the device is operating (booting) and it is producing 12 volts (and 5 volts to hdd).&nbsp; I have tried a different hard drive.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to get the device into tftp mode.&nbsp; I have tried all sorts of combinations of holding down buttons and powering on.&nbsp; The ready light will flash 5 (or is it 6 times? - I should know by now) and then go out, but I can never ping or tftp the device.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty much out of ideas.&nbsp; It could still be the power supply, maybe my digital meter samples too slow to detect voltage changes that might cause a reboot, having said that I think the reboots occurr at the same regular interval not a random times, so maybe not power supply.&nbsp; I dont know if there are some pins on the board somewhere I could short to cause a reset, whether that would be any different than pressing the reset button.&nbsp; I think the serial console is beyond me.&nbsp; I have just about given up, I&#039;ll wait a couple of days to get used to the idea and then move on, unless I get some inspiration before then.&nbsp; I&#039;ll download your image just in case.&nbsp; I hope others benefit from your work.&nbsp; Thank you again for taking the time to supply this information.<br />Martin.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi larmoe,<br />i&#039;m happy to hear your compilled firmware.<br />building the image is nice, but i&#039;m not 100% in it :-).<br />Would you be so kind to compile a firm using HDD (with 3 partition like mentioned before) instead of USB?<br />it would help me a lot.<br />thanks<br />bonym</p>									</div>

					<p>Larmoe,</p><p>Thanks once again.</p><p>1) I have got it working now for some weeks, compiled the primary kernel straight from your .config and the secondary as an initramfs in accordance with <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23901">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23901</a>. One problem persists: When I do a cold reboot (after a power-off) the system boots the primary kernel (firmware) but remains in a loop on this error:</p><p>=============<br />....<br />Freeing unused kernel memory: 136k freed<br />Please be patient, while OpenWrt loads ...<br />irq 3: nobody cared (try booting with the &quot;irqpoll&quot; option)<br />Call Trace:[&lt;8000a2fc&gt;] 0x8000a2fc<br />[&lt;8000a2fc&gt;] 0x8000a2fc<br />[&lt;80059f00&gt;] 0x80059f00<br />[&lt;8005a0d4&gt;] 0x8005a0d4<br />[&lt;8005a8d8&gt;] 0x8005a8d8<br />[&lt;8004e008&gt;] 0x8004e008<br />.....<br />.....<br />handlers:<br />[&lt;8015dd3c&gt;]<br />Disabling IRQ #3<br />irq 3: nobody cared (try booting with the &quot;irqpoll&quot; option)<br />Call Trace:[&lt;8000a2fc&gt;] 0x8000a2fc<br />....<br />etc<br />=================</p><p>After a second (hot) reboot using the reset button, the system starts up normally</p><p>In a country with many power outages, that is not very handy. Any idea how to solve this? Indeed use the irqpoll option? Do you have similar experiences? Or could it be a consequence of having not enough NVRAM available for the JFFS? (need to look up that error report).</p><p>2) Still need to figure out why the system won&#039;t boot when a second USB-device (an external HD) is attached. I think that there I need to do some tweeking of the rc.local and use labels and/or UUID of the USB-boot stick and the external HD to tell the system from where to boot.</p><p>Regards,<br />Maarten</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Maarten</p><p>I have the same problem. The router gets stuck in the kexec image after a cold boot, and the usb image doesn&#039;t load. I think that it&#039;s a memory/hardware problem since the router boots normally, when the &quot;halt&quot; command is issued before the power is disconnected.<br />Unfortunately this doesn&#039;t help in case of sudden power cut.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Regards <br />Lars</p>									</div>

					<p>The point is to avoid removing the internal HDD, having to put it into a PC, copy the files to it, then put it back into the router which isn&#039;t really easy for everyone.<br />Afterthat we got a working router without usb needed at all (I don&#039;t need any usb on it as I use the internal hdd).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello!</p><p>To: larmoe<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>larmoe wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>To-do next: Build a initramfs image to load from USB.</p></blockquote></div><p>I have a asus wl700ge router with 2mb rom. I took a USB-Flash Image from here (<a href="http://wl700ge.hezik.nl/node/116">http://wl700ge.hezik.nl/node/116</a>) and upload it in a router. Firmware is working, but how can I move it to a USB-Flash? Instruction from here (<a href="http://wl700ge.hezik.nl/content/30-change-root-hddusb">http://wl700ge.hezik.nl/content/30-change-root-hddusb</a>) is not suitable. Can you tell me, step by step, how to do it, since it is not described anywhere else for cropped version of OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
