					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>after days of hard work with lots of try&amp;error i finally managed to build firmware from snapshots for oxnas. to my big disappointment i noticed that till today noone managed to get a working java environment on that devices? how it comes? i tried to get rid of crappy medion firmware to switch to an better supported one, but with ffp i was at least able to run embedded java from oracle on my medion nas... its the last part of my puzzle for running minimserver on my nas with an way better firmware. there seems to be no packages of embedded java (oracle, phoneme, jamvm, etc) or any instructions how to compile one on my nas. can anyone plz help me out or explain why java isn&#039;t supported? it seems even arch or debian would come with java support on that device - but i prefer openwrt with luci as my knowledge still seems to be quite basic! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>thx i.a. alex</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry to be slightly OT: While I do not have an answer regarding Java, I would be interested if you installed OpenWrt into the flash memory of your oxnas device. Does it use squashfs and overlayfs, so that you can always revert to a &quot;known good&quot; OpenWrt installation?</p>									</div>

					<p>TBH, java is in general quite a resource hog, and most devices that run openwrt are fairly short on cpu cycles and memory. Not really surprising that java doesn&#039;t have high demand here.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m running JamVM 2.0.0 + classpath 0.99 on Barrier Breaker / Carambola2 - obviously happy to provide the patches you&#039;ll need:</p><p>- classpath has a serious bug where conversion of doubles/floats to strings leaks memory. The patch for that is in the associated bug report (easily found with google) and easy to apply.</p><p>- classpath glibj.zip is compressed with standard jar (zip) compression. It gets *larger* when incorporated into squashfs. So you will want to patch the generation of glibj.zip or re-compress it with -0 compression. While you&#039;ll find glibj.zip is now 20MB, the resulting firmware image will be 700K smaller in the end. Really.</p><p>- A complete OpenWRT firmware build including JamVM 2.0.0 and full classpath0.99 is ~9MB for a Carambola2 and runs with a reasonable memory footprint.</p><p>- If you use the -verbose:class option of jamvm, you can collect information on which classes you really need and substantially reduce the size of classpath glibj.zip.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danak6jq</strong> on 2 Jan 2015, 01:58)</p>

So I took the existing jamvm Makefile: feeds/oldpackages/lang/jamvm/Makefile and updated it to pull down and build JamVM 2.0.0, then placed that Makefile in my own (local) custom feed as jamvm2. After configuring my feeds.conf.default to include the local feed and the usual ./scripts/feeds update -a / install -a, I ran &#039;make menuconfig&#039;, selected jamvm2 under Languages/Java and ran &#039;make&#039;</p><p>This takes care of the dependency on GNU classpath automatically - that&#039;s the problem with just cross-compiling jamvm and bundling up the install directory, you won&#039;t inherently get the dependencies.</p><p>Specifically, this line in jamvm/Makefile is worth paying attention to:</p><p>&nbsp; DEPENDS:=+zlib +libpthread +librt +classpath @!avr32</p><p>For classpath, I needed to include the floating point string-coversion patches, and I modified the classpath/Makefile to pick up classpath-0.99.&nbsp; Hence, I get turn-key builds and package creation with the OpenWRT buildroot bits. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any reason the patches involved won&#039;t work for any OpenWRT platform supported by jamvm.</p><p>It is worth learning how to create your own local feed; it isn&#039;t difficult and makes life easier.</p><p>Anyone care to suggest a place to stash an archive of the patches I used?</p>									</div>
