					<p>I&#039;ve messed up my flash on my G2.&nbsp; After a sysupgrade my router slowly stopped working.&nbsp; Right after the flash the router would stay on but be unreachable by ethernet or WIFI.&nbsp; Assigning addresses to my ethernet (192.168.0.2,192.168.1.2, etc) I would get nothing.&nbsp; </p><p>When I try to power on I get the blue light on (beside the power button) for about 2 seconds and the green power light stays on for about 10 then shuts off.&nbsp; Other times the blue light does not come on but the power light flashes 23 times and goes off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to connect it to my raspberry pi via uart and once in a while I get 2 characters (sometimes an &quot;a&quot; with 2 dots above it, sometimes &quot;yo&quot; with dots above it as well).&nbsp; Any combination of key presses like hold reset + power or hold power and repeated presses of reset or combinations of those give no luck.&nbsp; I&#039;ve checked out the git hub for the Serial Console and stuck the &quot;1&quot; key down on my keyboard while doing all of the above.</p><p>Long story short I think the uboot might have been flashed over.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try to access the winbond flash chip via SPI tonight.&nbsp; If I can I am going to need the uboot image.&nbsp; Was wondering if anyone could help me out or maybe suggest something else I can do to bring this marvel of technology back to life!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have just bought the device and replaced the firmware with the one given in specific documentation page for this device and it works great. However, I really would like to compile my own firmware with choosing which packages/modules to install.
