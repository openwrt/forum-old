					<p>Not sure if this is still active but....<br />I&#039;m looking for a script I can drop on a N600 OpenWRT box that scans, and then connects, to multiple SSID&#039;s in a round robin fashion. So AP1,AP2,AP3 etc etc.I &quot;own&quot; the AP&#039;s, each SSID is unique, and I have the passwords/keys. Its simply to check that<br />a) the SSID is still broadcasting<br />b) when connected to the SSID, there is a route out to the Internet (so ping 8.8.8.8)</p><p>I&#039;m not 100% that this script will do it, or maybe it just needs a tweak (rather than me re-inventing the wheel).

					<p>Yes, that can be done.<br />So, let&#039;s say that you only want it to constantly scan and log the status to the syslog, and then you remotely connect by SSH to that box from time to time to check how it&#039;s been going?<br />You want to log only the failing APs?<br />Also, it be saved to a text file on the flash, as the syslog is lost after a reboot.<br />It will use very little space, unless the APs fail constantly and you never delete the file.<br />It may also stress a bit the flash endurance, but I think it would only fail after few years.<br />Just tell me and I&#039;ll kindly help on this, if I know how to do so!</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, but, the box should only have internet from the wifi side, otherwise it will may ping 8.8.8.8 from lan side.<br />Also, how will you connect by SSH if the box is scanning?(I guess you&#039;ll have to wait a bit when this happens, until it finishes)<br />Do you have a default wifi network to set when it&#039;s not performing the scan?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 4 Sep 2015, 01:56)</p>

The N600 is dual radio, so both I would like to be able to connect to known AP&#039;s in its radio range. I can see how when it connects, it may use the wired WAN side for the ping-but one of the curious things I have seen before, is that when you have dual WAN connectivity (so wired and wireless-to a secondary AP), the device always seems to pick the wireless (wlan0) as the default route! Not sure why but I suppose putting something like </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> curl ipecho.net/plain </code></pre></div><p> in the script, would let you know what WAN connection is being used?</p><p>For when the scan ends, would a sleep function, or just running it as a cronjob not do the trick?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry and apologies for not getting back to the thread-been mad busy at work, and not had a chance to try it out. It looks good, and keeps it simple.Discovered if the device under test, if in AP mode, runs the script, it will change the SSID to the last one successfully scanned-so am going to get a few dedicated units. Going to try it out on some small TP-703&#039;s, and see how they cope.</p><p>But looking good so far :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hell there</p><p>Been playing with this-could I ask for some things to be considered?</p><p>wlan0 on here looks to be 5G-is it possible for wlan0 to be the 2.4G radio and wlan1 for 5G radio-as this is how Openwrt sees it on my device?<br />I know this shouldn&#039;t make a difference on a dual radio device but I was trying it on a single (2.4g) device, and couldn&#039;t work out why I was getting errors :-)<br />Which leads me to my 2nd ask-is it possible to make the latest script (v1.0) have the option to use it on a single and/or dual radio? This way, I can use the same script on a &quot;working&quot; AP, regardless if its single or dual. When I started out on this, a standalone device looked the way ahead, but as you adapted the script to take a working AP &quot;down&quot;, and then back &quot;up&quot; , it got me thinking i could run this as a cronjob on a working device, and run it at 4am in the morning (or maybe twice a day), thereby not interfering with many customers?</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>cheers</p><p>cabs</p>									</div>

					<p>Reboot and it will check again, or mod the script as you like.<br />It won&#039;t check the wifi while being connected because it will break internet everytime.<br />It only checks when it fails, then if WiFi1 is found it will connected to it.</p>									</div>
