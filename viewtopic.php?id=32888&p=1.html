					<p>One small correction: The TL-WR710N has the same chipset, flash and RAM as the 703N, and should be supportable by OpenWrt. I haven&#039;t got one yet, but intend to get one if/when they are released with an EU plug integrated.</p><p>I know the 700N and 702N are definitely 2MB flash as you mentioned.

					<p>I have just received a sample WR710N device and I am wondering how best to proceed towards getting OpenWRT on to it (with least chance of bricking!)<br />I was hopeful that the device might be the same internally as the WR703N and accept the same firmware image.</p><p>Is there any way to probe the device to get it to indicate any information about its structure?</p><p>Sam<br />You mentioned that the device has the same internals as the WR703N. Do you have a link to that or any other information on the device please?&nbsp; I have explored the TP Link web site with the assistance of Google translate, but the info I found was marketing rather than technical.</p><p>I have connected to the device and brought up the Chinese language web page. I found the firmware upgrade page but it is different to that for the WR703N device. Instead of uploading the new .bin file through the web interface, it appears to want to use TFTP.</p><p>This is the translation of the SoftwareUgradeRpm.htm page:<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />By upgrading the router software, you will get new features.<br />File name:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wr710nv1-cn-up.bin<br />TFTP Server IP:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.95&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (This is my laptop static address)<br />Current software version:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4.18.22 Build 110928 Rel.62011n<br />The current hardware version:&nbsp; &nbsp; WR710N 1.0 00000000</p><p>Note: Please use the wired LAN port for software upgrades. Please select the upgrade consistent with the current hardware version of the software. Upgrade process can not turn off the router power, will cause damage and can not use the router. Upgrade process about 40 seconds, when the upgrade is complete, the router will automatically restart.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>There are two buttons on the screen but I can&#039;t work out how to translate them.</p><p>Any suggestions on how to proceed are welcome.</p>									</div>

					<p>@maurer<br />Thanks for the response.<br />I have the case apart. <br />Let me know if you would like some photos and / or screenshots.</p><p>The chipset is Atheros AR9331 and Zentel A3S28040FTP-G5, so pretty similar to WR703N device.</p><p>I haven&#039;t located the serial port points as yet - they are not as obvious as on the WR703N device.<br />I am waiting to receive a USB serial adapter for the ttl serial port on a 703 device, so if I can locate the points on the 710 I will try to grab the boot output. It looks like it will require removing the board from the case and then operating from a separate power supply in lieu of the built in mains power supply.</p><p>I got bold and tried to tftp the 703 .bin file to the device but no joy.</p><p>I set up a static IP and ran tftp on my laptop, pointed to the IP of the TP device and tried to &#039;put&#039; the file in the normal manner, while clicking&nbsp; the Go button on the web page but it comes straight back with an error message.</p><p>I have not seen this method of upgrading on other devices so I am not sure what the expected process is.<br />the page has two fields - one for the file name, and the other for the tftp host IP address.</p><p>The built in help page translation for the firmware upgrade is as follows:</p><p>Follow these steps to upgrade the software:<br />1 Log in to the company&#039;s Web site (<a href="http://www.tp-link.com.cn">www.tp-link.com.cn</a>), download the latest version of the software.<br />2 Open the TFTP server, use the Browse button to select the downloaded file.<br />3 In the &quot;File&quot; column, the downloaded file name.<br />4 in the &quot;TFTP server IP&quot; column, the local host&#039;s IP address.<br />5 Click &quot;upgrade&quot; for software upgrades.<br />6 After the upgrade is complete, the router will automatically restart.</p><p>But clearly I am missing something in the process.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s worth remembering that TP-Link have started shipping different hardware to China and international markets. For example, the latest Chinese version of the TL-WR841ND has 2MB flash / 16MB RAM, whereas the international version will retain 4MB flash and 32MB RAM. I suspect the same thing may be happening on the TL-WR700N and others too.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t follow all of this too well. Does this mean that the 710 can take this firmware or not? I just got it and the Chinese firmware is kinda hard to use.</p>									</div>
