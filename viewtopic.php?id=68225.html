					<p>I have started playing with IPv6.<br />From the wiki (wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#protocol_dhcpv6), I thought I would have to install the odhcp6c package in order to get a (global scope) IPv6 address.<br />But it turns out I don&#039;t, because SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) just works! Can someone help me understand why?</p><p>In /etc/config/network I have the following section:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan0&#039;

    option proto &#039;static&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This is my default config for a static IPv4 address.</p><p>As soon as I connect eth1 to my upstream router, my device sends a Router Solicitation message, and the upstream router replies with a Router Advertisement message (with M=0, O=0, and a Prefix Information Option with a valid 64-bit prefix, with L=1, A=1).</p><p>ifconfig confirms that my device now has a globally-routable IPv6 address (2001:...), using the link-local address (fe80::...) of the upstream router as the default gateway.</p><p>This is all great, but I&#039;m confused as to what daemon is managing all this.<br />If I run ps, there is no dhcp client running, IPv6 or otherwise.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkinsell</strong> on 24 Oct 2016, 14:40)</p>

					<p>This is _not_ correct.</p><p>odhcpd is the daemon which is sending RAs into your LAN, the kernel does not send RAs. If you do a &#039;ps&#039; I think you will find odhcpd.

					<p>bkinsell, </p><p>I understand better now. Since your ISP doesn&#039;t support PD, you will need to &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;relay&quot; the ISPs prefix over to your LAN segment. The easiest way to do this is to use odhcpd&#039;s &quot;relay&quot; feature. Look here for how to configure (just below the dhcpv6 config)<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6#router_advertisement_dhcpv6">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/networ … ent_dhcpv6</a></p><p>The default route in IPv6 is a function of the RA itself. Because the router is sending RAs, it becomes the default route. It happens automagically. You don&#039;t configure it.</p><p>You can put odhcpd into RA mode only, but since you don&#039;t have PD, there won&#039;t be anything to advertise in the RA, relay will work better for your situation. You might find the documentation on odhcpd helpful. There you can see there is a ra_management parameter that controls the M &amp; O bits. What isn&#039;t said is that the O bit is always on (which is harmless).Use the value of &#039;0&#039; for SLAAC only.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/odhcpd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/odhcpd</a></p><p>Because cell providers typically don&#039;t do PD, the IETF has created a standard to deal with this, essentially extending the providers /64. It is a good read.<br /><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7278">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7278</a></p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure why you want this pain. Typical deployments of IPv6 will either use DHCPv6-PD or static config. I have a test environment with a downstream router which gets PD from my upstream router. It works rather well.</p><p>But that said. Forwarding, by default will turn off listening to RAs. However, you _can_ turn it on, as I meantioned earlier. As for the default route not being propagated.

					<p>I want this pain because I need to support cellular WAN. IPv6 SLAAC is standard in all GSM networks. See 3GPP TS 29.061. Where I work, we don&#039;t have a cellular operator offering IPv6.

					<p>Note that it is possible to have the kernel accept RAs even when routing. You can either set accept_ra to 2, or configure a mixed host/router.&nbsp; The latter concept can be a bit confusing though.&nbsp; The thing is that you can turn off &quot;forwarding&quot; on your wan interface with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo 0 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/wan/forwarding</code></pre></div><p>without actually affecting routing.&nbsp; Packets will still be routed in and out of that interface as long as /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding is 1.&nbsp; But the wan interface is now treated as a host interface wrt RAs.</p><p>When it comes to the issue of sharing a single /64 prefix received in a RA, that is usually not a problem as long as you have only a single lan interface.&nbsp; Just route the /64 from wan to lan, and make soure you have a default route back (which you&#039;ll usually have anyway). You could possibly leave a /128 for the wan interface if you need or want that.&nbsp; An address more or less doesn&#039;t matter much in IPv6 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
