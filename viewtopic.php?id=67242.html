					<p>Iam planning on buying a new router. Currently i have a FritzBox 3490 which works ok but has some disadvatages. I am a linux newbie but i want to learn so in addition to switching from windows to linux on all my pcs i wanted my new router to be an openwrt compatible one. <br />I dont have many requirements. My internet connection is a symmetric 1Gbit/s and its no &quot;dial in&quot; or so. Only NAT from the router is needed since iam in the LAN of my provider. So i can do without a modem.<br />Another problem is that my appartment is an a house which has walls like a bunker. My FritzBox is not able to provide me with good wifi even in the next room of my 50 square meter appartment. Surfing works ok but streaming 1080p media is somewhat only possible with huge buffer pereferences. So my new router should be &quot;strong&quot; at wifi.<br />So any recommendations are welcome. <br />I&#039;ve picked two routers which sound interesting.<br />TP-Link Archer C9 V1<br />TRENDnet TEW-827DRU<br />The TP Link obviously is in the list here so it will work. But iam not shure with the Trendnet one. Although it uses compatible Qualcomm hardware. Any thoughts on those two? I&#039;d not be unhappy if i had a router that is a little cheaper than 120 euros.</p>									</div>

					<p>Performing NAT and fire-walling at 1Gbit speeds is going to be challenging for almost all consumer grade routers. Proprietary firmware often gets around this limitation by using some off-load functionality so looks much better in simple benchmarks (say <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/tools/charts/router/bar/74-wan-to-lan).">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/tools/ch … n-to-lan).</a> But none of these IP/NAT/whatever offloads are integrated into the mainline linux kernel and hence are not available in openwrt/lede (I also heard rumors that the offloads often will only work for a very limited set of firewall rules and are mostly tailored to achieve good numbers for marketing than robust network performance, but that could just be developers declaring the &quot;grapes to sour anyway&quot;). Up to 600Mbps (including traffic shaping), I seem to recall, people reported good results with pcengines&#039; apu2 devices (see <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/apu2.htm).">http://www.pcengines.ch/apu2.htm).</a> Maybe you should consider turning your existing fritzbox into a dumb AP in one of your rooms while running an APU in the other room (and connect them via ethernet).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

Also to build openwrt-images :-), over night for a fresh build.<br />I use voyage as OS, a stripped down debian. Very handy, as I can use newest drivers, for mobile comm, for example.<br />Usually the APU is connected to the web via DSL, but I have a LTE-modem as backup.<br />No extra NAS; just a large external HDD attached to the APU.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>augustus_meyer</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 16:43)</p>

					<p>I could do that. But i want to have as few devices as possible. Plus i want to sell the fritzbox. Also i dont need gigabit speeds via wifi. sorry if my post was missleading. 1Gbit/s is only wanted on the LAN ports. &quot;Enough&quot; wifi speed for solid streaming of 1080p or even 4k media would be more than enough. My computer and NAS are connected via LAN cable anyways.</p>									</div>

But there are also a lot of expensive boxes out there that are total crap. So i wanted your help to sort out what would be wise to invest. The TPLink Archer C2600&nbsp; would come at 160€.

					<p>Thanks. Maybe i just wait one more month, safe up some more money and buy the apu board. It also hast the advantage that it will force me to actually learn what kind of hardware i have and not just click around in a fancy looking web gui and in the end nothing works. And considering that ill get 80 euros at least for my fritzbox the reinvestment is not that high. So 170euro for the board. Another 50 for the wifi card and maybe 50 more for antennas?</p>									</div>

Now those might not be the fastest cards out there (no idea how many of the ac wave2 features they support) but they still look pretty decent. In your case with bad attenuation due to your walls you really need to think out of the box and either go for multiple APs or try to optimize the position of the AP so you get decent/acceptable reception everywhere in your apartment instead of great reception close to the router and shitty perception in the other room (you might want to think about of placing one antenna in the non-APd room for example <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ... which would be a perfect excuse of getting out the Bohrhammer and make a hole through the wall)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moeller0</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 17:40)</p>

Is it likely to get a wifi card which could enable me to get a good signal through the thick concrete walls so i can stream some videos on my laptop or smartphone. No matter if they are small low res videos or fullhd stuff. I mean its only in the adjacent room.</p></blockquote></div><p>Well pcengines not only sell the boards, but also the matching cases, power supplies and wifi antennas and cards (either ath9k (see <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/wle200nx.htm">http://www.pcengines.ch/wle200nx.htm</a>) or ath10k (see <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/wle600vx.htm">http://www.pcengines.ch/wle600vx.htm</a>) based, the two chip sets that have most opensource wifi latency reduction work ongoing). Now those might not be the fastest cards out there (no idea how many of the ac wave2 features they support) but they still look pretty decent. In your case with bad attenuation due to your walls you really need to think out of the box and either go for multiple APs or try to optimize the position of the AP so you get decent/acceptable reception everywhere in your apartment instead of great reception close to the router and shitty perception in the other room (you might want to think about of placing one antenna in the non-APd room for example <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ... which would be a perfect excuse of getting out the Bohrhammer and make a hole through the wall)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks for all your efforts. Since my grandparents will visit the us and the prices there are way better ill order in the end of september. Are the antennas from the US store ok or can i do better with the wle200nx card?</p><p>Also would it not be even more awesome to use a full linux like debian on the apu? I mean performance wise the board is pretty much overkill for a small os like openwrt?</p><p>And i&#039;d love to just bring LAN to all rooms there but its only a rented appartment and my landlord did not give his ok for stuff like that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>felixm</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 18:17)</p>

					<p>Along time ago I strategically went with a router and separate AP to improve coverage.&nbsp; I happen to have an older PC-Engines ALIX and use it with GB switches with great results.&nbsp; The router is in the basement (where the cable comes in) and feeds a TP-Link WDR-3600 in an upstairs closet centrally located.&nbsp; It has some holes in the lower levels, and I have used a HooToo TM-02 bridged wirelessly to fill the gap and my backyard.</p><p>You should be able to use an AP and bridge it to a router (with LAN ports) if you align it to the doorways.&nbsp; This probably will penetrate a closed wood, but not a metal door.&nbsp; Look for something with removable antennas so you can upgrade if you are not happy with the performance.&nbsp; </p><p>Consider identical devices which support WDS so you can roam between rooms.&nbsp; You can find some relatively inexpensive travel routers made by GL.inet with removable antennas, but you will only get 300Mbps on 2.4Ghz.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/shop/">http://www.gl-inet.com/shop/</a>&nbsp; You can probably get faster with 2 C2600, but at a much higher cost.</p><p>Regarding the PC-Engines wireless cards, there is a very limited supply of choices for these and I am not clear if the cards are actually supported in OpenWrt.&nbsp; Everything needs to be built.&nbsp; While the cards are dual band cards, they can only be configured to operate on a single band at a time, so for dual band you need 2 cards (hardware restriction, not software).&nbsp; The PC Engines metal case is only designed for 2 antennas, and one would need to do some drilling to add a second pair for the second card.&nbsp; As a router, I think they are great, but the reality is that you can get better software that&#039;s easier to configure for these (pfSense, IPFire, etc)</p>									</div>

					<p>The MT7621AT SOC is supposed to be able to cope with 1 GBit/s loads as well, which might help you to find cheaper devices (https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Special:Ask?title=Special%3AAsk&amp;q=%3Cq%3E[[CPU1+model::~MT7621*]]], e.g. <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-860l">D-Link DIR-860I</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zbt/wg2626"> ZBT WG2626/ WG3526</a>). In case if thick concrete walls and the needs for excellent wireless performance, you definately want to put an access point into every room that needs it.</p>									</div>
