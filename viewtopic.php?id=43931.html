					<p>Thinking to avoid some confusion and noob mistakes, I bought one of these 703 routers with OpenWrt already installed. My evidence that it IS installed is the router doesn&#039;t show as a wifi accesss point like my mistakenly purchased 702 does (oop). As is pretty typical for anything I try, step 1 of the instructions runs amok.</p><p>So, I plug my 703 into my Windows 7 laptop with an ethernet cable. Do I need a router inbetween? No, it IS a router. My computer sees it as &quot;Unidentified Network&quot; with &quot;No internet access.&quot; So I turn off my WIFI internet connection because my &quot;MiFi&quot; router responds to 192.168.1.1. Then I start a command line and type TELNET 192.168.1.1, expecting to see the OpenWRT graphic and drink recipe, but it says Telnet cannot connect. </p><p>&quot;Connecting to 192.168.1.1...Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed&quot;</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried using a browser to go to 192.168.1.1 but that gets no response.</p><p>Perhaps I don&#039;t know how to connect my Windows 7 laptop to the &quot;network?&quot;</p><p>Perhaps I need to get a serial port and wire to the insides according to the other long thread?</p><p>Following the instructions at <a href="http://wiki.villagetelco.org/index.php?title=Building_a_Serial_Port_for_TL-WR703N">http://wiki.villagetelco.org/index.php? … _TL-WR703N</a> I got the lid off without hurting myself. Inside, I find a label on the ethernet connector that says:</p><p>&quot;TL-WR703N 1.6 126019&quot;</p><p>So I THINK it isn&#039;t the 1.7 version that turns off the ethernet port when it&#039;s flashed.</p><p>There&#039;s also a blue label on the big chip that says 128.</p><p>I think I&#039;ll not snap the lid back on just yet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Torby</strong> on 2 May 2013, 21:03)</p>

					<p>Actually, I don&#039;t have a router. All I have is a 4G wifi thing that I connect my laptop, and occasionally my droid to.

If I connect to OpenWrt, I can get LuCI on my browser. Doing so disconnects my laptop from Verizon so I don&#039;t have internet. </p><p>If I plug in the ethernet cable, I can get LuCI but my laptop can&#039;t seem to resolve DNS names until I unplug the ethernet, though web sites I&#039;m already connected to still seem to respond.</p><p>My idea for the TP-LINK thingy is to have it serve its own web pages for anybody who cares to connect to it&#039;s wifi. Of course, to do that, I need to learn how to manipulate it. Of course, I&#039;d also need to make instructions for the users like, &quot;Connect to this wifi and use your browser to go to...&quot; The TP-LINK would be embedded in the device it controls.</p><p>Am I mad?

					<p>You are right lizby, there are no definitive positive successes, and there is the (to my mind) huge issue that you can&#039;t use the serial to recover.<br />Depending on the application, it might be possible to use a couple of unused GPIOs as a bitbanged serial, or even i2c<br />But for speed, usb-serial adaptor and a proper hub. In fact, just thinking... if it is an adruino board then how about usb-usb? Don&#039;t know what the state of arduino USB libraries are though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t really know yet how the 703 will talk to my hardware. That&#039;s a little ways down the road.

					<p>I don&#039;t exactly understand why being connected with your 4G dongle means you can&#039;t access the WR703N.&nbsp; What ip number does your laptop get from the 4G?&nbsp; Can&#039;t you assign a static IP number in that range to the WR703N (and also to your lan connection on the laptop)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well that isn&#039;t that hard, it is because your router servers a gateway and the your 4g dongle serves one as well both with the same metric as windows is concerned, so it chooses at random what devices it tries to connect to the internet.</p><p>in <strong>/etc/config/dhcp</strong> add under <em>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>        list &#039;dhcp_option&#039; &#039;3&#039;</code></pre></div><p>That should solve it, or just simply set a static ip address in your computer without the gateway and dns servers.</p>									</div>
