					<p>Hi.</p><p>The kernel package is just a metapackage. Never use opkg upgrade to update your system, it will just fill up the flash. The kernel image is _not_ stored on the filesystem, an opkg upgrade will _not_ update the kernel. The _only_ solution to update a running OpenWrt installation is a _reflash_.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
