					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve successfully created a tunnel between my OpenWRT router and a pfSense Virtual Machine elsewhere on the internet. Phase 1 and 2 of the IPSEC tunnel are successfully negotiated and the tunnel is &quot;up&quot;. However, i&#039;m unable to ping across the tunnel and I suspect this may be due to firewall settings on the OpenWRT end - on the pfSense end all traffic is permitted to and from the tunnel. Indeed, if I initiate a ping from the pfSense side, I can see the ESP packets arriving on the OpenWRT&#039;s WAN interface.</p><p>Beyond permitting IPSEC traffic with the following rules in /etc/config/firewall i&#039;ve made no firewalling changes;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option src &#039;wan&#039;
        option name &#039;IPSec ESP&#039;
        option proto &#039;esp&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;

config rule
        option src &#039;wan&#039;
        option name &#039;IPSec IKE&#039;
        option proto &#039;udp&#039;
        option dest_port &#039;500&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;

config rule
        option src &#039;wan&#039;
        option name &#039;IPSec NAT-T&#039;

        option dest_port &#039;4500&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;

        option proto &#039;ah&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.firewall">firewall</a> page on the OpenWRT wiki is a bit confusing. From what I can understand, it binds the IPSEC tunnel to a new VPN zone and policies are applied based on that - this matches my experience with commercial products. However, with a StrongSwan IPSEC connection, there is no interface I can bind to the VPN zone.</p><p>In short, i&#039;m a little confused as to what firewall changes I need to make in order to permit the decrypted IPSEC traffic to be processed, rather than being dropped as seems to be the case now. The connection configuration on the OpenWRT side is below, and is near identical on the pfSense side aside from changing left/right etc. 10.0.0.0/24 is the subnet of my OpenWRT LAN.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>conn pfsense
        left=1.1.1.1
        leftid=1.1.1.1
        leftsubnet=10.0.0.0/24
        right=2.2.2.2
        rightid=2.2.2.2
        rightsubnet=192.168.1.0/24
        authby=secret
        auto=start
        ike=3des-sha1-modp1024!
        esp = aes256-sha1!</code></pre></div><p>If anyone could offer any insight, it would be appreciated. Thanks.</p><p>Edit: I should note that i&#039;m running BarrierBreaker 14.07-rc3.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KingJ</strong> on 10 Sep 2014, 18:44)</p>

					<p>Still bashing my head against this. Interestingly, if I start a ping from OpenWRT&#039;s LAN interface to the LAN interface on the other side of the tunnel, a tcpdump on the OpenWRT WAN interface shows the ICMP packets going out over the WAN, i.e. towards the ISP&#039;s gateway, rather than being encapsulated in IPSEC.</p><p>I also notice that if I add a vpn zone via LuCI, I get a few warnings when reloading the firewall on the command line. Not sure if it&#039;s related, i&#039;m clutching at straws here. I suspect that this is because the VPN zone has no interfaces assigned and hence no addressing information?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Warning: Unable to locate ipset utility, disabling ipset support

					<p>The VPN concept I designed and wrote down in the wiki consists of four parts.</p><p>1) Define a standard openwrt /etc/config file that takes informations about the VPN infrastructure. E.g. foreing endpoints tunneled networks, credentials and so on. You can see it just like the usual strongswan/racoon configuration but in the openwrt style.</p><p>2) The part that is essential for the IKE damons is read out in the provided start scripts. These do nothing more than translating the new syntax into a daemon-specific standard syntax. </p><p>3) The config part with the network definitions must be mergend into the openwrt firewall. So we can route the traffic. The additional firewall script takes care of this.</p><p>4) with 1-3 in place we should have a working VPN solution but it will deny all traffic (to be safe and to emulate other firewalls). So we must add firewall rules between the newly created VPN zone and the existing zones manually in the web interface or the openwrt standard config files.</p><p>To sum it up: I tried to create a fully integrated solution that might be a little harder to understand and implement. But if everything works the rest is just the usual firewall-rule-clicking. Sorry for being out of this topic for the last two years but everyone is invited to take over maintenance.</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>
