					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m working on a DIY project with a LaFonera router. I&#039;ll have up to 8 relays/tyristors being switched by a PCF8574 (via I2C Protocol) and I&#039;ll read temperature through a DS18B20 sensor (via 1-Wire protocol). <br />LaFonera router have 4 GPIO&#039;s available so I&#039;ll use 3 (2 for I2C and 1 for 1-w), and I&#039;ll still have 1 available for anything else :-)</p><p>I have the latest trunk version loaded and the I2C part is working fine. For further information on the I2C part, check my other topic. <br />Now, I&#039;m trying to implement the 1-Wire part based on the <a href="http://squidge.sourceforge.net/w1/">http://squidge.sourceforge.net/w1/</a> site. However, I&#039;m having some difficulties because it seems the W-1 module is not sucessfully loaded into the kernel: &quot;w1_gpio: Unknown symbol ar231x_gpiodev (err 0)&quot;</p><p>What I have so far:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/sys/devices# opkg list-installed | grep -i w1
kmod-w1 - 2.6.37.6-1
kmod-w1-gpio-custom - 2.6.37.6-2
kmod-w1-master-gpio - 2.6.37.6-1

w1_gpio: Unknown symbol ar231x_gpiodev (err 0)
root@OpenWrt:/sys/devices#</code></pre></div><p>Googling for these keywords resulted in few clues...</p><p>I&#039;m prety new to OpenWRT, and I&#039;m having difficulties identifying the correct contact for each package. I mean, I could try to contact the package owners in order to get some user-manual, or just some tips on how to get it working...</p><p>Any suggestion or tip? Would it be a patch needed?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I contacted Karl and it seems there is no problem with the GPIO patch.<br />As I could understand from Karl&#039;s e-mail (I don&#039;t have much knowledge about programing) it seems there is a problem with the way the w-1 code &quot;asks&quot; for a pin because the &quot;ar231x_gpiodev&quot; symbol should never have been getting accessed by any one wire code anyway, it should just be asking the kernel about getting a gpio pin, not a particular gpio platform driver. This is handled with gpiolib and sysfs by a &quot;struct gpio_chip&quot; pointer.&nbsp; This sounds like &quot;less-good&quot; code in the 1-wire implementation.</p><p>How can I know who is/are the developer of the w-1 drivers, so I could warn him/them about this problem?</p><p>Thanks!<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I found your mistake: by installing the w1 packages, you used the repositories of the openwrt servers, instead the one that you built. You need to edit /etc/opkg.conf. Most likely the first line links to something like downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk and so on. Change that to the directory, where you keep your built packages (bin/atheros/packages). So, if you have enough free ram on the router, just copy it over to /tmp and change that mentioned line in opkg.conf to file:///tmp/packages. Alternatively, you can run a web server on your pc and change the link in opkg.conf to something like http://url/to/your/pc/packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just uninstall w1-gpio (and w1-gpio-custom first, since it depends on w1-gpio) and then install your version. From what I could see, it is only w1-gpio which causes the troubles about the ar231x_gpiodev dependency. You can also just copy those two packages to /tmp on your router and then issue something like: opkg install /path/to/your/packages.opkg</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Jabss,</p><p>I have a ASUS WL-500g Premium (V1) router where I have 2 USB ports and 4 RJ45 ports. I installed OpenWRT on it and though to use OWFS and digitemp (or rrdtool) to read temperature in my house (home automation ideas).</p><p>Now I found how to use DS18B20 (temperature reader) on an RJ11, I have two main question I presume ou will easily answer. I ask you this because I am not an electronical guy.<br />1) As my router has RJ45 and USB ports :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) can I directly connect my DS18B20 on the RJ45 cables like this (for RJ11) ? : <a href="http://rosset.org/linux/temperature/howto1.html">http://rosset.org/linux/temperature/howto1.html</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If well, as I want to have more than one DS18B20 on the cable :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I) on which line (from the 8 lines in the cat 5 RJ45 cable considering the standard RJ45 connection) must I connect the DS18B20 ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;II) must I connect all the DS18B20 in serial on the two same colored small cables (the 2 selected lines of the cat 5 RJ45 cable) or must / could I use two other different lines ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) when the DS18B20 is connected on the two cables could I directly connect the RJ45 cable to the RJ45 port of the router or must I use a specific connector between the router and this cable (on which the DS18B20 are mounted) ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) then if I must connect it to the USB port which adapter must I use between the USB port and the mounted RJ45 cable ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks for your experience share.</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Miguipda,</p><p>I&#039;m not familiar the Asus WL-500gP router, anyway I&#039;m afraid getting your project done will not be so easy as connecting a DS18B20 into any of the router ethernet ports... <br />However, I think it might be possible to acomplish it in one of two ways.</p><p>But, before anyting else, please keep in mind that any router&#039;s RJ-45 ports are intended for ethernet only. If you connetct anything else (like the DS18B20) to it you can risk to burn something, so please don&#039;t do it :-)</p><p>Option 1)<br />My home automation projects rely on routers GPIO&#039;s, which are &quot;general purpose Input/Output&quot; pins that you can control its state with software ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Pu … put/Output</a> ).<br />The OpenWrt W-1 packages mentioned in the above posts implement the 1-wire protocol in one of these GPIO&#039;s. That&#039;s where I connect the DS18B20 (which is, as you know, a 1-wire device), and where I suggest you to connect.<br />The drawback of this is that you&#039;ll need to open your router and identify one available GPIO. Again, I don&#039;t know the WL500gP router and therefore don&#039;t know if there is any available (you have to check the forum for HW details on your router. In alternative you may want to open a new post asking some help in finding it). Sometimes it might be needed to use a GPIO that can be feeding a router LED (GPIO&#039;s are frequently used to feed status LED&#039;s).</p><p>Option 2)<br />When checking the site you referenced I could notice other possibility: The DS18B20 &quot;talks&quot; 1-wire, right? I believe the site has a 1Wire-RS232 converter (I&#039;m not so good at french - <a href="http://rosset.org/linux/temperature/howto2.html">http://rosset.org/linux/temperature/howto2.html</a> ). Then, you just need a cheap RS232-USB converter. Maybe something like ( <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-2-0-RS232-Serial-9-Pin-9P-DB9-Adapter-Converter-/150701346254?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2316800dce">http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-2-0-RS232-S … 2316800dce</a> ).<br />In order to choose the RS232-USB converter, you may need to choose a chipset that is supported by OpenWRtT. Again, you can check the forum and try to find some information about it.<br />You&#039;ll have to check the feasibility for this option. Searching and asking help in the forum might be necessary.<br />This option can give you more work, but at least you don&#039;t need to open your router.</p><p>So, answering your questions:</p><p>1a) No, you can&#039;t. Please keep in mind that any router&#039;s RJ-45 ports are intended for ethernet only. If you connetct anything else (like the DS18B20) to it you can risk to burn something, so please don&#039;t do it :-)</p><p>1a I-II) You can have as many as DS18B20&#039;s in the same bus as you want. You can connect them in paralell with the same pinout because the 1-w bus is designed for it. However, you&#039;ll have to connect it to a proper pin (try to find a GPIO in your router and then load the software mentioned above). It will not work if you connect to a RJ-45 port!</p><p>1b)You can connect the DS18B20 directly into any GPIO port (don&#039;t forget the pull-up resistor). There is no connector/adapter that translates 1-wire to Ethernet, so you can&#039;t really use the RJ-45 ports for the DS18B20.</p><p>1c)As I mentioned in the option 2, you can try to have a 1-wire &lt;-&gt; RS232 &lt;-&gt; USB connetction. As you know, almost all USB devices need a driver to work properly. In this case you&#039;ll need to find a RS232-USB adapter that has it&#039;s driver implemented in the OpenWRT.</p><p>I know that probabily this wasn&#039;t the answer you were expecting, but I&#039;t better you know this in advance rather than risking damaging your material... Keep in mind that it will be possible. The thing is that it will be more challenging :-)</p><p>Good Luck!<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>a and b: no, the sensor is 1wire, the rj45 is ethernet. totally different things.<br />c: there are some usb to 1wire adapters available. this one for example: <a href="http://omnima.co.uk/store/catalog/1-Wire-USB-Port-Adapter-p-16153.html">http://omnima.co.uk/store/catalog/1-Wir … 16153.html</a> (seems to work with kmod-w1-master-ds2490)<br />you should read a bit about 1wire, wikipedia is a good start (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire</a>), but also your preferred search engine will help.</p>									</div>
