					<p>I have the above router, and was hoping to use it as a universal repeater to extend the range of my wifi network. My main router / access point is flashed with DD-WRT now (D-Link DIR-615) and works perfectly (IP 192.168.1.254).<br />I bought my new device (TL-WA701ND) to act as a universal repeater, which it is supposed to be able to do out of the box (with TP-Link firmware). My experience was less satisfactory, so I decided to give OpenWRT a go. Unfortunately, I&#039;m getting nowhere fast. I have a little Linux experience with desktop and server, but not enough knowledge about networking to accomplish this.</p><p>So...</p><p>I flashed my TL-WA701ND with the trunk squashfs build as per <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wa701nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wa701nd</a> ( openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa701n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin from <a href="http://firmware.pberg.freifunk.net/experimental/trunk/bleeding-edge/ar71xx/">http://firmware.pberg.freifunk.net/expe … ge/ar71xx/</a> ) - I had to rename this ( wa701nv1_en_3_12_6_up(110210).bin ) to fool the device into accepting it from the TP-Link upgrade firmware web page. I read through the TL-WA741ND wiki page for instructions on how to do this - WA701ND is essentially the same, but has only 1 combined WAL/LAN ethernet port (which, in hindsight, is a bit limiting).</p><p>Telnet then worked, but appeared unable to reset the default password - it didn&#039;t actually change the password, despite the expected &quot;Password for root changed by root&quot; - but logging into the basic (?mini) Luci page was accomplished with root / admin (a guess - this isn&#039;t documented anywhere). I had to manually set gateway and DNS to 192.168.1.254 (as per my main D-Link router).</p><p>firstboot command confirmed that it had already been run.</p><p>At this point, I connected the TL-WA701ND by ethernet cable to the main router to allow internet access for updates etc (using fixed IP 192.168.1.1). </p><p>The following to install Luci and WPA2 client support:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg remove hostapd-mini
opkg install luci wpad-mini</code></pre></div><p>After this, I&#039;m unsure how to accomplish a repeater. Is this even possible with this particular device?</p><p>I have followed instructions here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27019">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27019</a><br />Using a combination of Luci and manual editing with ssh / vi - I connected as a client and broadcast a new SSID. However, I cannot seem to connect these 2 things. i.e. without ethernet cable, the TP-Link router cannot get internet access.<br />I have tried different IP subnets (i.e. D-Link 192.168.0.1 and TP-Link 192.168.1.1), same subnets (i.e. D-Link 192.168.1.254 and TP-Link 192.168.1.1).</p><p>I have returned to default settings on 3 occasions now (by rebooting while pressing the QoS repeatedly) and repeated the above steps, with multiple variations on the same theme.</p><p>This is my current setup:</p><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>Thanks for the advice. I&#039;m clearly a beginner, but enjoying experimenting...<br />I followed instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a> to slightly edit my setup (and set static routes on my D-Link main router/AP).<br />D-Link router: 192.168.0.254<br />TP-Link repeater: 192.168.1.1 (LAN) &amp; 192.168.0.101 (WAN reserved on DHCP lease)<br />The 2 wifi interfaces are now named lan and wan (as per above link).</p><p>Anyway - it appears that it is possible to have both AP (access point) + client on the same wifi radio. To confirm:<br />I can ping the internet (<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>) from the TP-Link &quot;repeater&quot;<br />I can ping the TP-Link &quot;repeater&quot; from my main D-Link AP<br />I can connect to the TP-Link repeater by wifi from my computer</p><p>1 problem persists:<br />DNS lookup from a computer connected to TP-Link works (i.e. it resolves IP address for <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>) - however, pinging does not return anything.<br />I&#039;m hoping this is a firewall or routing issue, rather than a problem with the same wifi radio being used for the connection. I believe this, since using the ethernet cable connection on TP-Link (which I believe is still part of the &quot;lan&quot; network) also does exactly the same (i.e. resolves DNS, but no response).</p><p>Any help? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ugm6hr</strong> on 7 Feb 2012, 20:41)</p>

					<p>Got it - I think.<br />The D-Link AP settings were slightly wrong... Destination LAN NET = 192.168.1.0 (not 192.168.1.1 as suggested by the wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a> ) in the Advanced Routing (static routes) setting.<br />Added static DHCP lease on 192.168.0.101 for the TP-Link. </p><p>And it all seems to be behaving itself as expected.... If it stays this way, I&#039;ll report back.<br />Thanks all.</p>									</div>
