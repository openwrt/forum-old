					<p>Hi guys, I have a Routerstation Pro and it only has 16mb of flash, but it has an SD-Card slot, so I want to run my os off the sd-card instead. I tried following the instructions in the guide at <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs%282f%29KamikazeConfiguration%282f%29BootFromExternalMediaHowTo.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs% … HowTo.html</a> and it got me most of the way there but I ran into a few problems and ended up having to modify the main script that it uses (/etc/init.d/bootext) quite a bit. I figured I would share the updated version with you guys. I have allowed it to remain completely abstracted and generic so it should run on anyone&#039;s setup.

					<p>Mactalla:</p><p>block-extroot is tiny. It&#039;s not the file system or any of the tools. It&#039;s just a &quot;stub&quot; used by the sysinit to pivot over to the filesystem (i.e., a filesystem formatted on USB, for example) you specify. The additional benefit is that it is really, really simple to configure and activate. Assuming your USB stick (or onboard USB flash) is formatted already and you copy over your JFFS partition to it, all you need to do is make or change a few variables in the /etc/config/fstab then reboot to activate. </p><p>It&#039;s a lot less painful than every other method I have seen.

					<p>I have no problem with the size.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s tiny.&nbsp; The point I brought up is that it claims to need to be built right into the image, meaning someone who wants to go this route must setup a whole dev environment for OpenWrt and build a custom image for their router.&nbsp; This completely negates the whole point of having pre-built images for the various routers available for download.&nbsp; I agree it would be nice to have a prepared package to not need to manually install the pivotroot scripts (the method I&#039;m currently using).&nbsp; But that small bit of manual work is less than creating my own images.</p>									</div>
