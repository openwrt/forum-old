					<p>Great job! and thank you for these explanations! Although it look simple, it probably requires quite a lot of skills and tons of patience!</p><p>I am sure that the above will be useful to other persons willing to reverse-engineer some other boards using the same techniques.</p><p>All this work provides full understanding of the TL-WR703N hardware so it is now possible to squeeze all the juice out of this wonderful little platform.</p><p>But this job is also a good way to learn how a modern router is working at the lowest level, bringing knowledge of the different circuits (SDRAM, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, USB) to the electronic hobbyist&#039;s delight!</p><p>On my side, I started to look at the internal layers to find if I missed something, and I may have the explanation for my &quot;L&quot; via: this via is actually at +3.3V, and the R95 0603 resistor is in fact a pull-up (through so-far hidden internal layers...) for the &quot;B42&quot; AR9331 pin, which is also connected to GND via C86, forming what looks like an RC timing network... So I suspect that the &quot;B42&quot; pin is actually an active-low RESET pin (I was still missing this one somehow!)!</p><p>I will update the EagleCAD schematic and layout to match your pictures perfectly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Probably JTAG interface will be available in the event of a failure to boot from flash memory, for example AR7241.<br />Starting with processor AR7241 - nTRST placed on CS pin the SPI flash-chip because in the case of a damaged bootloader - CS goes to logic &quot;1&quot; and since bootloader does not boot - JTAG not disabled in software (more correctly JTAG pins are not reprogrammed as GPIO pins).<br />Also, I noticed that the device wr841n v8.0 (AR9341 with JTAG) - nTRST not used on pin header.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dioptimizer</strong> on 14 Dec 2012, 13:07)</p>

					<p>I can ask for a quote of AR9331 as well. Unfortunately we would need to achieve a minimum order quantity. I think ZoomZoomLuke seems to have easier and likely cheaper access to the chip.</p><p>Apart from that the board needs to be modified for legal reasons. As far as I know creating a perfect copy of the original PCB would be problematic. Making modifications like USB hub, antenna connector, memory card slot and pin headers could be enough to prevent legal problems.</p><p>Another problem is the missing &quot;ART&quot; software from Atheros needed for the calibration process. Village Telco had the same problem with the Mesh Potato but they solved it: <a href="http://villagetelco.org/2009/11/rf-hacking/">http://villagetelco.org/2009/11/rf-hacking/</a></p>									</div>

So we will need to find one PCB house that can do this cheap, and also provide the solder paste stencils.</p><p>For this kind of board, hand assembly with a soldering iron is not possible. Given the AR9331&#039;s dual-row pinout, hot air is not trivial, so a reflow oven is recommended.

Then the RF needs to be calibrated using the ART (Atheros Radio Test) software (which I don&#039;t know how to get, except by signing and NDA with Atheros) and corresponding tuning values written into Flash memory during manufacturing.</p><p>Also, consider that there are AR9331-based SMT modules starting to appear in China for about the same price as a TL-WR703N, with more or less GPIOs... They do not provide all the connectors for Ethernet, antenna, USB, etc, but this may be seen as an alternative to making our own board...</p><p>But this could also make a nice Kickstart/Indiegogo (I am not US or UK-based) campaign!</p>									</div>

					<p>There are some reason make this project not possible:<br />1.Some thing are illegal...or we need put many effort to workaround it,just like base on ath9k driver write the &quot;art&quot; process code.<br />2.We can&#039;t make a ar9331 based device at a good price same as tp-link WR703N.<br />3.This is not a &quot;profit&quot; project,but we also need prepare many $ for this project kick off,I think why there are less &quot;open hardware&quot; project than &quot;open software&quot; is that &quot;open hardware&quot; project need $ to start...</p><p>Beacuse convert a SCH with wifi related is not easy as make a &quot;bread&quot;:),the equipment for test wifi part are also hard to find,not every factory have this &quot;cool&quot; equipment ,and there are many things will happen when convert a SCH to a product,some man must foucs on it day and light...<br />So the cost $ will be more surprise when compare with the WR703N&#039;s price!</p>									</div>
