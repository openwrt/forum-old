There is one SPI address-window, also if you look <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=192459#p192459">at the same table</a>, you can see two more reserved addresses (0x1EFFFFFF, 0x1BFFFFFF). At these locations is the same address-window - reflection or mirror. The number of reserved addresses in proportion to the available internal CS# line (i.e. CS0 = 0x1F .. CS1 = 0x1E .. CS2 = 0x1B .. - it is for example, addresses can be in any order).<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>What is it for?</p></blockquote></div><p>This is needed for the use case if we using at the same time all the available capacity (16Mb+16Mb+16Mb) for the bus SPI.

But as I understand it may seem that it is trite.<br />Have you considered <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?langpair=ru|en&amp;u=http://wiki.openwrt.org/ru/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420/deep%2525mmc%2525hack">this variant</a>?<br />Original url: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/ru/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420/deep.mmc.hack">http://wiki.openwrt.org/ru/toh/tp-link/ … p.mmc.hack</a></p><p>P.S.<br />In general, NOR flash memory - the most primitive memory for fast loading information in the memory of device. This flash-memory is not the best/cheapest variant to increase capacity on the router. For example, on a platform of ALFA-AP96 (first generation processors AR71XX) - NOR flash memory is used as a kind of &quot;missile carrier&quot; after the kernel is loaded into memory&nbsp; - GPIOs of spi0.0 reprogrammed into pins for NAND-flash.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dioptimizer</strong> on 24 Feb 2013, 18:26)</p>

					<p><span style="color: RED">WARNING: THIS IS ONLY FOR TPLINK AR7240/AR7241 DEVICES, **NOT** AR9331, AR9341, ETC !!!</span></p><p>Hi, I did the same thing (flash upgrade to 8M). <br />Did you know that ar7240 can run at 400MHZ right?<br />I found an uboot in a chinese forum that works with my wr740n v2, modded to use 8MB flash, and...<strong><span style="color: red">also overclocking abilities!!</span></strong></p><p>The maximum stable frequency for me is 430MHz (DDR goes up to 430MHZ too).<br />At 440MHz it worked but the LAN did not longer work in the uboot or openwrt. But I was able to boot at even 480MHz! sadly...no LAN <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> so stuck at 430MHz.<br />Remember that no LAN = no way to transfer data to the router = no way to recover = BRICKED!!.<br />From 350 to 430MHz, it went from 235 Bogomips, to 286! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p><strong>How to overclock:</strong><br />Open the modded uboot with an Hex editor, go to address 0x1FD00.<br />The uboot is modded, it has 4 OC profiles. Any of them can be enabled by setting to &quot;1&quot; an hex value.<br />The last byte of each profile is the multiplier. DON&#039;T CHANGE THE &quot;08&quot; !!</p><p>If you saw the bootlog, it says &quot;Ref:5MHz&quot;.<br />So, we have to use a multiplier in base of that speed to get the AHB clock speed.<br />In the way it works, the DDR and CPU speed is the double of the AHB.<br />Example: 40 multiplier.<br />AHB speed: 40*5= 200MHz.<br />CPU and DDR will be 200*2=400MHz</p><p><span style="color: red"><strong>Remember that the bin file works in hexadecimal!! decimal 40 = 28 hex !</strong></span></p><br /><p>Here a nice pic I made for better explanation.

I set it to 410MHz, which I think is a safe value.<br />Still a big performance improvement from the stock 350MHz!</p><p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23958662/uboot_410MHz.bin">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23958662/uboot_410MHz.bin</a><br />Remember that I&#039;m sharing it because it worked like a charm for me.

					<p>The first improvement will be on concurrent connections, if you use emule, bittorrent and other programs that may create 1000&#039;s of connections.<br />Also it will give better performance if you install additional heavy programs on the router, ex. Transmission (bitorrent client), samba, etc.<br />My unmodded wr740n with 32MB RAM crashes after ~30 minutes if I start Transmission and let it download some torrents.<br />In my computer it works well, but having the computer running all the day is not something that I&#039;d call efficient.<br />So my RAM is on the way, I&#039;m waiting for it to upgrade my routers.<br />For just surfing and downloading few files with Jdownloader, it works perfect with the stock RAM, so for that scenario it won&#039;t give a difference on performance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 28 Feb 2013, 10:35)</p>

So all is 128KB (0x20000).<br />The MAC is stored there, too.<br />Don&#039;t worry about the size of&nbsp; the compiled bootloader.A big part of the 128KB is free, but you have to erase the full uboot, to ensure that nothing of the old data remains there, which could cause conflict or bugs with the new uboot.</p>									</div>
