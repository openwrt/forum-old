					<p>I would think it would be easier to add a serial port and then put the transmitter on that.</p><p>However I think remote controlls only need on and off so maybe the status led would do the trick, but it would be more coding since lirc wouldnt support it obviously.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, <br />the driver serial_lirc.c unfortunately uses the handshake lines to switch the infrared LED on/off (or to detect incoming pulses).</p><p>As only RXD or TXD are present on the internal connector this would probably require some external CPU which would switch on/off a 38kHz carrier.</p><p>Or can the UART be switched into a baudrate of approximately 380 kBaud? (350..550kBaud?) In this case &quot;carrier on&quot; could be implemented by continuously outputting characters 0x0f to the serial port.</p><p>Otherwise the CPU would have to toggle the DMZ Led (thanks mbm) at about 76kHz (probably with interrupt disabled...)</p>									</div>

					<p>The Asus WL500G has one USB 1.1 Interface and one parallel printer port. But again, you can attach also USB&lt;-&gt;LPT Adapters.</p><p>AFAIK Asus does not release the source of the printer port module (splink_parport.o), but you can use their binary module without modifications.<br />It&#039;s also possible to write a own small module which just writes to the base adress of the printer port (it&#039;s not PC-like 0x378...) to put data onto the port pins.<br />I helped a friend to write such a module and it works well to switch low current LEDs attached to the parport.</p><p>If you wait a few more weeks you may buy the Asus WL500GX which has USB 2.0.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Yesterday evening I tweaked/changed/messed up lirc_serial.c to use the WRT54GS v4 DMZ LED GPIO line to send IR signals.&nbsp; I just now replaced the DMZ led by an IR led and it is working just as it should :-).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done detailed measurements to check if the generated signals are 100% correct, but it seems to work.&nbsp; The receiving part is completely disabled since I didn&#039;t really need it.&nbsp; Perhaps it is possible to use the button behind the cisco logo as input for this, but I didn&#039;t check it at all.</p><p>I&#039;ve packeged the needed stuff at <a href="http://users.pandora.be/esteevens/Linksys/lirc_0.8.0-1_mipsel.ipk">http://users.pandora.be/esteevens/Links … mipsel.ipk</a></p><p>To use lirc, you need a configuration file that matches the remote control of the device you wish to control.&nbsp; In my case I&#039;ve recorded a config file for my remote using a linux live CD with LIRC (stux-linux-0.8.1).&nbsp; Once you have this config file, you need to store it on your WRT54GS as /etc/lircd.conf.</p><p>To start using it load the 2 required kernel modules and start the LIRC daemon:</p><p>insmod lirc_dev.o<br />insmod lirc_serial.o<br />lircd --device=/dev/lirc/0</p><p>To send e.g. the power on command to your device, use:</p><p>irsend SEND_ONCE JVC_CA_E33 power</p><p>JVC_CA_E33 is the name of my remote control, so you should replace it by the name of your remote control (or use irsend LIST &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; to see the name you should use).</p><p>Have fun<br />Eddy</p><p>P.S.

To include the files with the gpio stuff in lirc_serial.c, I&#039;ve used hardcoded paths.&nbsp; Again I need to dig into the makefiles to figure out where a cleaner solution should be fitted in.</p><p>3. In the package/lirc/Makefile, I have hardcoded the destination path for the kernel drivers as being /lib/modules/2.4.30.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t there a less version dependant solution?</p><p>4.
