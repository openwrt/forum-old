					<p>I didn&#039;t find it really difficult.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how everyone does this, but my steps:</p><p>1) Get someone handy with a soldering iron to attach an IDC-10 socket.&nbsp; I can solder big wires but anything finer details like a PCB I got an associate to do this for me.&nbsp; These routers all seem to have the 2x5=10-pin spot for it, it&#039;s just a matter of someone fitting a connector to that spot.&nbsp; The connector is 50 cents at Fry&#039;s, and if you have a friend handy with a soldering iron this part is something I think it&#039;s good to do just in case.&nbsp; If you think you will need it rarely I would probably use a &quot;straight&quot; connector so you open the case when you need it. I chose a right-angle connector and cut a hole in the plastic so it sticks out and I can hook up more easily.</p><p>2) Order a MAX233 kit from somewhere, these guys are popular:<br /><a href="http://www.compsys1.com/workbench/On_top_of_the_Bench/Max233_Adapter/max233_adapter.html">http://www.compsys1.com/workbench/On_to … apter.html</a><br />I contacted them and asked could I get it already fully assembled and they said extra $6 for all soldered up so I bought that.</p><p>3) The only bit of real work I had to do, buy some connectors and some ribbon cable and make one cable.<br />I used the cheap plastic connectors that just squeeze onto ribbon cable, again to avoid fiddly soldering. So I used a <br />couple of IDC-10 females to give me my link to the MAX233 kit. I just hooked everything flat at the router end and did all<br />my wire-flipping at the MAX233 end of the cable to give me the right pin at the right places. I hook the bottom row<br />of the IDC-10 into the MAX233 if I want ttyS0 and the top row if I want ttyS1.&nbsp; I only needed a single serial port really<br />I just played around with the other one a few times although they do have a version that will give you both at once.<br />The other side of the MAX233 kit is a standard DB-9 serial port so cables for that to your computer are easy to find.</p><p>I have read you can also use certain Nokia cell-phone adapter cables and just butcher up a new end for it so you end up with a solution<br />that will go straight into a USB port on your computer, look around for that if you are interested.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 26 Feb 2007, 00:13)</p>

					<p>One thought I had which would be a relatively clean hack is instead of the IDC-10 being soldered to the logic board, instead wire up a 3.5mm stereo jack, which can be added to the enclosure easily because of its size, then from there all you would need is a custom cable to whatever serial adapter you&#039;re using for when you need it.&nbsp; Since all you need is three wires, this should work great.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well my setup uses 4 wires. There&#039;s the 5V, GND, and the TX and RX pins. How would you power the circuit doing the signal conversion otherwise?</p><p>With ordinary serial you can get away with only 3 wires, but that&#039;s because the signals are already at the right level.&nbsp; The output of routers is at 3V instead of 12V hence the need for a small circuit to adapt to accepted RS-232 standard.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 26 Feb 2007, 04:52)</p>

					<p>Ah, I&#039;d forgotten the +5, my setup didn&#039;t need it as my receiver could handle the lower voltage.&nbsp; My original thought was an RJ-11 jack, which is a 4 wire setup, but I didn&#039;t see an easy way to mount the jack.</p>									</div>

					<p>Both serial ports on all Linksys routers are wired the same way, I&#039;m not sure you&#039;d consider the router end as particularly supporting either DTE or DCE as you would actually see that distinction only at the other end of your serial adapter circuit.&nbsp; The only difference for ttyS1 is it defaults to a much lower baud-rate, and isn&#039;t running a console shell.&nbsp; I used ttyS1 to play around with a GPS at one point, but never really finished the project.</p><p>I continue to be annoyed that neither port supports software or hardware flow control.&nbsp; The console at 115K sometimes I lose characters.&nbsp; I wish there were enough of a market for a hobbyist version of these boards from BroadCom, because there are a couple of things I&#039;d like see in a &quot;PLUS&quot; version like real serial ports or double the amount of RAM.&nbsp; Oh well.</p><p>I added a couple of pics of my serial-port setup to the Wiki page:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … /WRTSL54GS</a></p><p>Perhaps I should have put it off on a separate HowTo page, may do that later if I add more details.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 27 Feb 2007, 21:27)</p>

					<p>The wrt350n is not supported yet.&nbsp; I managed to talk my boss into donating one to OpenWRT, so we could see support in the not too distant future.&nbsp; The reason I installed the serial port on mine was to test any beta code.</p><p>WRT the GL crashing problem, I have been watching that closely.&nbsp; I really wish you luck vincentfox, it seems to be bugging quite a few people, including me occasionally.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just got my cables today via DHL. Quicker than I thought!</p><p>You were right though, I went to local Radio Shack and the few stereo-jacks they had on hand all had very short threaded section.&nbsp; Went to Fry&#039;s Electronics in Sacramento.&nbsp; Their part #3343172, Philmore 3.5mm stereo phone jack looks the right part. Bit more length on the threaded section.&nbsp; Cost was US$1.69 and looks the same as the one pictured in your link.</p><p>Forgive a silly question, but the cable diagram on FTDI site shows:</p><p>TIP=TX<br />RING=RX<br />SLEEVE=GND</p><p>I will assume you wire it so TX goes to pin4=TX on the board? Just want to make sure it&#039;s not TX for one device is RX for the other.&nbsp; Will be doing soldering tomorrow.</p><p>Again, great work!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 27 Apr 2007, 10:29)</p>
