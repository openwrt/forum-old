					<p>Interesting - so this one DOES run linux, not VXworks....i suspect that they may well swap to VXworks in a later version, but they&#039;re probably being nice to us linux folk. If they do later run VXworks on the thing, then they will likely make an &#039;L&#039; model. The WRT54G will probably be outmoded by this, if the draft standard holds.</p><p>--neg</p>									</div>
