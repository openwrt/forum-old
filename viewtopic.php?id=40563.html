					<p>Hey everyone.<br />I just bought a TL-WR703N and I&#039;m really keen to flash it with OpenWRT, but I&#039;ve never done something like this before so all of the documentation pages that I have read are a little bit confusing.</p><p>The page for the router itself <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a> says that it only supports several variants of a thing called Trunk. Cool.</p><p>I hunted around in the download page, but there does not seem to be a thing called trunk? So I scoured the router page again, and saw that in the boot log they were using attitude adjustment. Cool. I went through the download page again and clicked what I assume was the correct firmware by selecting the Ar7 chipset, however on this page I was greeted by about 100 .bin files <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/ar7/generic/.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … /generic/.</a> Right, what the hell do I do with these?</p><p>So I went to the guide for installing OpenWRT <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing</a> which told me to install &quot;the OpenWRT firmware image&quot;. Right, which one?</p><p>So hunted around and found this page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware</a> which told me to download a preassembled image file from the downloads page.

Are they different versions of OpenWRT? Is this the same as trunk?</p><p>I&#039;m sure your documentation makes a lot of sense to router hackers and geniuses like yourselves but It&#039;s very difficult to follow for someone like me with a moderate level of linux and router knowledge who just wants to flash their router.</p><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> if someone could just give me a link to the firmware file that I need to upload to my router that would be fantastic. </p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>methyleneprince</strong> on 16 Nov 2012, 08:40)</p>

					<p>I agree that the current documentation is more developer-oriented than user-oriented, and this is a shame.</p><p>You just missed the right link in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">TL-WR703N router page</a>: it is in the &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#flashing">Flashing</a>&quot; section, you should take the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">squashfs-factory.bin</a> file.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br />This is the short story. But if you are curious to understand why it is so complex, read on, here are some clues!</p><p>The different OpenWrt firmware versions are organized into a development tree, where the &quot;trunk&quot; is the latest, bleeding-edge version, and former stable releases are forming branches that forked from trunk at one point back in time. Each branch continues to grow, as bugs are found and corrected.</p><p>Having the firmware organized in such a version-control tree allows to retrieve any version/subversion at any point in time during the development, and it is of course very convenient. The version-control system mainly used by OpenWrt is &quot;Subversion&quot; or svn for short.</p><p>In order to make it clearer to refer to (at least for developers!), each major branch (including trunk) receives a &quot;nickname&quot;: for trunk, it is currently &quot;Barrier Breaker&quot;, and the latest branch that forked from trunk recently (in October 2012) is &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot;, then older ones are &quot;Backfire&quot;, &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and &quot;White Russian&quot;, as described in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/history">history page</a>.</p><p>Unless you want to do some bleeding-edge development or your router is not supported by an existing stable branch, you&#039;d rather avoid using the &quot;trunk&quot; version, as it may not be stable at all and is also not very user-friendly (no web admin interface by default).</p><p>As it supports your TL-WR703N router, I strongly suggest to use the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; branch, which has been forked from trunk in October 2012, but is not yet release as there&nbsp; are still some bugs in it, so we are currently at beta 2 version here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … .09-beta2/</a></p><p>Unlike OS desktop systems, operating systems for network devices are supporting a large choice of incompatible hardware processor architectures, this explains the number of directories in the link above. The processor for the TL-WR703N is the &quot;ar71xx&quot; (and not &quot;ar7&quot; like in your previous link), and for this processor, there are 2 Flash memory organizations: either &quot;generic&quot; or &quot;nand&quot;: for the TL-WR703N, it is &quot;generic&quot;: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/ar71xx/generic/.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … /generic/.</a></p><p>Now for the 100s files in this directory... Again because of differences in hardware, each device needs a specific firmware file, incompatible with firmware files for other routers, even if they are using the same processor, so the ones you are interested in are prefixed with &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-&quot;: you are down to a choice among 4 files!!!</p><p>OpenWrt uses 2 main Flash disk organizations: one which contains a read-only &quot;squashfs&quot; partition and a read-write &quot;jffs2&quot; partition that &quot;overlays&quot; on top of the &quot;squashfs&quot; partition, and one which only contains a single &quot;jfsf2&quot; read-write partition. This is done for safety reasons, the first one offering a secure fall-back system when you misconfigure your router or erase some important things, so I would recommend to use the &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-&quot; rather than &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-jffs2-&quot; files.</p><p>Down to a choice among 2 files: there is one file suitable for upgrade from the original manufacturer-supplied factory firmware, and one suitable for upgrade from an already installed OpenWrt device. Depending on the device, they may be radically different, but in the case of the TL-WR703N router, they are almost identical, the first one being equivalent to the second one with only extra padding at the end to be compatible with the original TP-Link firmware upgrade procedure. So here is eventually the file you need: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … actory.bin</a>.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance to install the firmware onto the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 16 Nov 2012, 09:36)</p>

What are the benefits of using the jffs2 version? Do you get slightly more space?</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes, you can write files and install packages with both Flash layouts.</p><p>The squashfs layout is using a read-only rootfs squashfs partition, on top of which a jffs2 partition of the size of the remaining space in the 4MB Flash memory is overlaid, using a mini_fo or overlayfs filesystem, see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout">the Flash layout</a> for details.</p><p>As a user, it provides a single read-write root partition, but in fact, you access the read-only squasfs files, unless you try to delete/modify them. In this case, all your modifications are stored in the jffs2 partition, masking the original files if the overlayfs is mounted.</p><p>As an additional benefit, the squashfs compression is slightly better than the jffs2 compression, so if compiling your own OpenWrt, you&#039;d rather put the maximum number of packages preinstalled on the squashfs partition, by selecting a package withe &quot;Y&quot;, rather than&quot;M&quot;, that would create an optional package to put on jffs2.</p><p>What is nice with this layout is that if you mess up things, you can still go to the &quot;failsafe&quot; mode by pressing the recessed reset button during the boot while the LED is flashing, and you get a telnet available at 192.168.1.1 WITHOUT the overlayfs BUT with a working squashfs.</p><p>The failsafe mechanism is also present in the jffs2 layout only, but if you really mesed up things, you may have to go back to a serial console (using a TTL-UART &lt;=&gt; USB adapter) and U-Boot to restore a working config <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>One advantage of the jffs2-only layout though is that you don&#039;t duplicate (both in squashfs and jffs2) files in Flash, so it is a better option in the long run if you plan to update packages later.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 16 Nov 2012, 11:44)</p>

					<p>Hey guys, turns out you were right, I was expecting it to host a wifi network or something out of the box.</p><p>Well, I got it working, and I was really happy with it, so I was playing around with all the different interfaces, trying to get it to talk to my router at home so that I could download some packages onto it and I did something stupid so that now I&#039;ve lost access to the router. </p><p>I just assumed that like every other router I&#039;ve ever played around with, that there would be a hard wired reset to defaults button, however I was wrong.</p><p>What I did to lose access to the router was change LAN from bridging eth0 and wlan0 to just over wlan0.</p><p>It still broadcasts OpenWRT wifi, and I can connect to that, but even if I manually assign my ip to be 192.168.1.3 and try to ping 192.168.1.1, nothing works. Any ideas? I&#039;ve tried this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>methyleneprince</strong> on 26 Nov 2012, 16:20)</p>

					<p>To get failsafe on the TL-WR703, just unplug/replug the router power cable, then when the LED starts flashing, press on the recessed RESET button using a paper clip.</p><p>You should have access to the router in telnet at 192.168.1.1 on the Ethernet jack (failsafe mode).</p><p>To reset all parameters to their default config value from there, just enter:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>firstboot
