					<p>Hi gnarfzkl,</p><p>I downloaded the latest image at Download section from OpenWrt site. You can find the link below. After this you will need to Hex edit the bin just like cmpyl0 said at his post. I did this with Notepad++ with Hex Editor plugin. After this, I configured my ethernet interface (lan cable) with a fixed IP (192.168.0.86). The next step was run a tftpd server (you can download an open source easely). After these steps all you need to do is power on the router while pressing the reset button for about 3 seconds. The router will look for a tftp server at 192.168.0.86 and download the image. Remember to rename the image file to wr841nv2_tp_recovery.bin.</p><p>This link <a href="http://form.tp-link.com/showthread.php?81462-How-to-recovery-the-router-when-you-bricked-it">form.tp-link.com/showthread.php?81462-H … bricked-it</a> will help you with the image upload procedure.</p><p>Link to download:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v10-squashfs-factory.bin">downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.0 … actory.bin</a></p>									</div>
