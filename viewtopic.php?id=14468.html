					<p>I had everything working well in white Russian. I decided to make the move to kamikaze. When i flashed the firm wear the browser just froze. It stayed on the browser for about a hour but i turned it off as that it froze. Now i can get a ping from 192.168.1.1 <br />but can not get a page in my web browser from the same address. I saw that some people say there is no web interface in kamikaze.</p><p> Now I only have windows units here but could set up a Linux box (but i am a Linux noob) and was wondering how exactly I could get in and put it back to white Russian. I tried to t ftp the firmware back in&nbsp; for about 3 hours experimenting with the timeout, but it always times out. Spend about 5 hours working with link sys to try to get back in. to no avail. They say its covered under warranty but when i try to turn it in they say to take it to sprint, then sprint says take it to link sys. </p><p>any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, well I thought I would ask about this bit, &quot;set up a web server on your pc&quot;. Well i have never heard about that. Will try to google that to see how to do it. I know it sounds funny but I really have never heard about that. </p><p>Ok well I got the router to where it says its in failsafe mode. The first light on the router is continually blinking the network link to the computer is solid, although the network link in the tray has the little yellow triangle on it I believe thats because in this mode there is no dhcp. </p><p>I opened putty and then checked telnet, then port 23 and the web address 192.168.1.1 it looks like its going to work but then after a bit it makes a windows error sound (sounds like &quot;bonk&quot;) then closes putty. </p><p>Ok then so then i open up the network connection and check the ip address. I set the ip address to 198.168.1.7 and the dns servers to open dns which is&nbsp; 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220. then the link says connected instead of having the little yellow triangle. </p><p>This looks a little better. </p><p>Now to putty, wow now i see a nice little text based open wrt deal and says root, etc. and a recipe for a drink. NIIIIIIICE.</p><p>now i am in new waters, or old if you count dos prompt. My world will be back to normal when I can flash over the white Russian I was using that was stable back on to the router and go back to &quot;GUI noob&quot; world. So now I ham staring at a terminal wondering about &quot;open a web server on your pc&quot; means. I have the firmware I need on the root of this drive named open.bin I guess i need a trx version.</p><p>I will check that other post and see if i can make sense of it. any ideas? &quot;Hold my hand mommy this rides scary.&quot; jk</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.&nbsp; Sorry, I don&#039;t have time to read through all your posts right now.</p><p>When flashing from a telnet/SSH session you want the trx version, not the bin version.&nbsp; The different bin versions are identical to the trx version in the same directory, except that they have a few bytes tacked on the beginning.&nbsp; The bin files are needed if you flash through the original Linksys web interface.</p><p>There is no password by default.&nbsp; OpenWrt does not have a default password.&nbsp; When you flash it, you can telnet in without a password.&nbsp; SSH is disabled until you set the password via telnet (or via the web interface if there is a web interface).</p><p>The White Russian firmware is at:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/default/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi … uashfs.trx</a></p><p>Here&#039;s an explanation of the procedure to flash from the command line:</p><p>cd /tmp<br />(this changes you into the /tmp directory, which is a sort of RAM disk on OpenWrt.)<br />wget http://...<br />(This downloads the image to the current directory.&nbsp; i.e. it puts it into the /tmp directory on the router.)</p><p>Then the step you seem to have missed:<br />(See <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14321">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14321</a> again)<br />mtd -r write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux</p><p>(mtd is the command that writes the image to the flash.&nbsp; &quot;-r&quot; means to reboot after flashing.&nbsp; &quot;write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&quot; tells mtd you want to write the image called openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx.&nbsp; &quot;linux&quot; is the name of the partition on the flash that mtd will write the image to.)</p><p>It should print out [e] and [w] over and over again to show that it is erasing a block of the flash and then writing a block of the image to it, then erasing the next block etc., etc. until it&#039;s finished.</p><p>I hope that gets you going.</p>									</div>
