					<p>I see Fry&#039;s Electronics has the <a href="http://www.frys.com/product/5970674">Hitachi SimpleNET NAS Head USB 2.0 Portable Dongle - SNET</a> onsale and am wondering if anyone knows this device is supported by OpenWRT.

					<p>The device is too new to be included - however I have started breaking it apart and have written one how-to and am trying now to use a buildroot to see if I can generate a running system. Try <a href="http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/ccii_11.html">http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/ccii_11.html</a> for how to connect a serial port and break into uboot.&nbsp; It uses the Star/Cavium Networks cns2132/str8132.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow. I am impressed on what you have done and achieved. Excellent works! I hope you will succeed.</p><p>After reading the <a href="http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/ccii_11.html">link</a> you provided, I think this little device is an excellent candidate to hack. It has plenty of Flash/RAM (8/64MB) to run various applications, i.e. asterisk, freeswitch, etc. I have friends down in one of S.E. Asean countries using a WiFi USB modem from their ISP. Eventually, I am sure this device can be used to connect to the WiFi USB modem and a router for them to share their devices to the Internet.</p><p>Thank you for letting us know and hope you will keep coming back to provide more updates. You may want to join the developer team here and update your works on the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewforum.php?id=2">Developer Only</a> forum.</p><p>I hope to get one unit to play with once the price is more affordable to me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi bdkibler,</p><p>thanks for the post - good work taking it apart. I&#039;ve got buildroot-2009.02 working with uClibc 0.9.28.3 - was able to build ssh client, tcpdump, lsof and other binaries, but now, after cross-compiling stock 2.6.16, I&#039;m having problem with getting kernel modules to insmod. Since I have also a working compiler for armv4l (tested only statically compiling hello-world.c), I might try to build the modules straight on the device itself. :-)</p><p>I&#039;d like usb/net/rtl8150.c (usb2ethernet) and usb/serial/mct_u232.c (usb2serial) so that I can use SimpleNET as a&nbsp; ssh gateway and terminal server to my primary router/firewall at home.</p><p>Any luck getting your own kernel to boot?</p><p>BTW, I&#039;ve reported a bug with the new firmware - <a href="http://www.parityodd.com/2009/11/oh-no-simplenet-woes.html">http://www.parityodd.com/2009/11/oh-no- … -woes.html</a> (last comment).</p>									</div>

					<p>Glad to hear my work is helping others out. I can not tell from your post if your using the serial port I found or<br />using their update process. </p><p>Sorry to say, I have not done anything yet - too many other projects are using up my time. I plan to get back to the project after the holidays, since I have a second unit now. It seems fry&#039;s puts them on sale at least once a month and I noticed that Staples had them on sale this last weekend.</p><p>It looks like your doing everything I would have done myself and am I right in thinking your running on the platform(?) and compiling there as well? I have noticed in buildroot code, plenty of patches for the kernel but have yet to dig into those patches - have you added patches to your kernel version yet? insmod failing might just need a patch. I hope you keep us posted on how your doing.</p><p>As to the bug report - great to know, as I will not update my unit I use for a NAS server. I think there are other bugs as well, but haven&#039;t had the time to document them or make sure they are a bug. I will post once I know for sure. Thanks for your work and comments!</p>									</div>

					<p>Today, I went to a local Fry&#039;s Electronic store and picked up two units of this device for $30/each. I opened up the package, connected the device to my LAN, and found it has a capacity of 64MB RAM. Although the output from <em>dmesg</em> indicated the CPU was clocked @250MHz, <em>cat /proc/cpuinfo</em> only returned a 192.51 BogoMIPS. The <em>top</em> utility showed the load average was 2.88 (that&#039;s pretty high, AFAIC) on idle. After running for about one minute, the bottom of the box was pretty warm. I am sure one can make use of such heat to make a cup of yogurt. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> I left the device on for an hour with no activity and the device seemed to have maintained its temperature.</p><p>So, is anyone working to port OpenWRT to this device? I just &#039;t wait to have mine running on OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does anyone know what <strong>Target System</strong> should I choose to create an OpenWRT SDK for this device? This way, I can use the SDK to compile programs, i.e. asterisk, etc., to run on this device.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am really interesting this device too. If some one successfully runs asterisk on this device, then I will buy too. This device is perfect for replacing NSLU2.</p>									</div>

You can click the link on my post above to find out how to order from Fry&#039;s Electronics online store. If you have a local Fry&#039;s Electronics store nearby, you can also order online and have an option to pick up @ the nearby local store.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 12 Oct 2010, 04:58)</p>

					<p>Any new updates on this project to make an Hitachi SimpleNET to work with OpenWRT. Lately, I noticed OpenWRT has started to support for a Cavium Networks Econa CNS3xxx based boards. I am not sure if that will be compatible and work with the CNS21XX platform used by a Hitachi SimpleNET.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just came back from a local Fry&#039;s Electronic s store and bought me a unit of Hitachi SimpleNET for $18.99. I know this device isn&#039;t as good and/or powerful as a Seagate DockStar. However, it has enough resources as shown <a href="http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/ccii_11.html">here</a> to host an Asterisk-1.8.x. With OpenWRT recently to support for a Cavium Networks Econa CNS3xxx based boards, perhaps efforts to support a CNS21XX platform used by a Hitachi SimpleNET won&#039;t be too much of a trouble. Afterall, its price, under $20, is really affordable these days, YMMV. I hope this will attract hackers here to start porting OpenWRT to this device.</p>									</div>

If you execute <em>make menuconfig</em>, enabled the <em>Advanced configuration options (for developers)</em>-&gt;<em>Show broken platforms / packages</em> option, you will be able to select <em>Target System</em>-&gt;<em>Cavium Networks Econa CNS21xx</em> platform. What I don&#039;t know is if this is the same platform used by the Hitachi SimpleNet NAS device.</p><p>I also have some of Hitachi SimpleNet NAS devices. I notice my device runs very hot on its original firmware, especially if I lay it down on a flat surface with its power LED facing up. In this position, the CPU is facing down and making a contact to the aluminum foil (i.e., it is hanging on its Mobo) as seen <a href="http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/p1010015.jpg">here</a>. As such, the collected heat can&#039;t get dissipated freely. The <a href="http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/corner/ccii_11.html">link</a> stated that once the unit gets disassembled, it is almost impossible to put the aluminum foil back to make a contact with the CPU that can easily get over heated. For this, one will need to cut off some part of the enclosure to solder the serial PINs.</p>									</div>
