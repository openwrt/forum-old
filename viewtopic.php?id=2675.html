					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve started writing a upnp guide in the wiki documents for OpenWRT.&nbsp; I now need to create an .ipk package for the upnp daemon so I can help folks get that easily installed onto their router.&nbsp; I understand there is already a package created by yani for the Linux-IGD upnp daemon, but personally I don&#039;t like the implementation compared to the simplicity of the Linksys one and would like to offer an alternative.</p><p>Ok, so now a couple of questions:</p><p>1. Since the source code is provided with the GPL tarball from Linksys, does this not need to go into the &quot;non-free&quot; package directory.<br />2. Once the package is complete (and tested properly) can we add it to the package database so that &quot;ipkg install upnp&quot; will just work?<br />3. Is anyone willing to provide a little assistance to a skilled, yet inexperience package n00b like me to get the package built.</p><p>If you&#039;re worried about my abilities in case you decide to help me, I can tell you that I&#039;m technically highly skilled and work in IT security.&nbsp; I just haven&#039;t done any coding for, well, years.&nbsp; So if you give me a little nudge in the right direction, I will probably put back a lot more than you need to put in.</p><p>Thanks folks,</p><p>Kaldek</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 21 Sep 2005, 06:40)</p>

					<p>Well folks, I have built the package.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t use any of the SDK in the end, because I basically already had the binaries and everything else needed.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t need to actually compile anything, so I just rolled my own IPK file based on the info I sniffed out here: <a href="http://www.uk-dave.com/tutorials/zaurus/ipkg.php">http://www.uk-dave.com/tutorials/zaurus/ipkg.php</a></p><p>I&#039;ll see how the masses like the package before I do anything silly like submit it to the package tree.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll also pull out the latest binary from firmware 4.20.07 and see if it&#039;s any different.</p><p>Kalde</p>									</div>
