					<p>Hi all - I recently purchased a DIR-615 E3 in the hopes of loading OpenWRT on it.&nbsp; After reading a bit on this forum and elsewhere I was able to load &#039;openwrt-ar71xx-dir-600-a1-squashfs-factory-10.03&#039; and well as &#039;...-10.03.1-rc5&#039; (I had to hex modify the hardware magic number (last few bytes) on both to &#039;AP99-AR7240-RT-091105-01&#039;) and all seemed to be fine except for one MAJOR problem - no internet.</p><p>I tried both firmware images listed above and it seems like the same issue persists - the WAN simply doesn&#039;t come-up and/or work which renders my efforts completely useless.&nbsp; Its odd since everything else seemed to work just great (LuCI, telnet, passwd, ssh, vi, etc).&nbsp; Is this a known issue ?&nbsp; If so is there a work-around ?</p><p>I realize that I&#039;m using a DIR-600 image with a DIR-615 device but many on this forum and elsewhere have noted that that works for them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since reverted back to the original D-LINK firmware and the router functions without issue (ie. the WAN works fine so its not a hardware fault/problem).</p><p>Do please let me know how best to debug this and/or what I should do next.</p><p>Kind Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello</p><p>I need some help flashing OpenWRT on a DIR-615 ver. E5.<br/>I have already some knowledge on OpenWRT (I have a Linksys WRT54G v. 3.0 runing OpenWRT), but I have never compiled a Firmware. <br/>I have read that the DIR-615 ver. E5 has the same hardware as the version E4 and can therefore be flashed with OpenWRT (as in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-615).">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-615).</a> But, as in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32274,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32274,</a> something with the signature of the firmware must be made. I am clueless about that. </p><p>Any help is apreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
