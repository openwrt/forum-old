					<p>For those unfamiliar with the device and it&#039;s prepackaged firmwares:</p><p>The Tor firmware sets up 2 SSIDs, 1 of which is a regular Wi-Fi network, and the other is a Wi-Fi network that routes you out the WAN to Tor.&nbsp; The regular Wi-Fi SSID will allow non-Tor WAN traffic and also LAN traffic.&nbsp; The Tor SSID will not allow LAN traffic.&nbsp; The LAN port does not route to Tor.</p><p>The Tor on LAN firmware does the above, but also routes the LAN port to TOR.&nbsp; Meaning, your only administrative connection is the regular Wi-Fi SSID.</p><p>Regarding your issue, this sounds like a similar issue: some kind of admin change causes the SSIDs to crap out.&nbsp; Most of the time I was in the web interface making changes, I was on the non-Tor based Wi-Fi.&nbsp; I was able to recover the unit by connecting to it via the LAN port.&nbsp; However, with the Tor over LAN firmware, that&#039;s not an option; the only management interface is the regular Wi-Fi SSID.&nbsp; But, since both SSIDs are not broadcasting, I can&#039;t get in to the management interface.</p><p>If I reset the unit back to factory defaults, I will likely start the process over again.</p><p>Obviously, I would like to use the tor over LAN firmware and change the SSID of the Tor Wi-Fi network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WertWertL33tQuestion3r</strong> on 20 Aug 2015, 01:29)</p>

					<p>Yes i see your point, Now i also want to use TOR combined with nodogsplash. But for now i will keep this in the back of my mind, I first need to get comfortable with Nodogsplash.&nbsp; Combining TOR with nodogsplash wuld be very nice to provide gratis, open but encrypted hotspots at small events that require some access to the web without brutally spilling personal data of the people that use the hotspot.</p><p>BTW.

					<p>I was able to make it work by SSH&#039;ing into the router.&nbsp; It took me a minute to figure out how to get the thing into failsafe, and I experienced the absurdity of vi, but here&#039;s how to recover it and change some stuff:</p><p>If you get into the failed state that I described in the OP, this will help you recover the unit and change the WLAN SSIDs.<br />1. Boot into failsafe. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gl-inet/gl-inet">Link</a> (scroll down to Failsafe mode).</p><p>2. Connect with telnet.</p><p>2.5 I think there&#039;s some commands you&#039;re supposed to automatically run in failsafe, but that&#039;s not clear.&nbsp; I obviously didn&#039;t run any commands, though I did see some an error when I tried to do something.</p><p>3. Give it the command &quot;reboot -f&quot;.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> At this point, the router SSID &quot;OpenWRT&quot; came back and I could connect to the Luci interface.&nbsp; The root password was gone (maybe I didn&#039;t set it?), but the &quot;tor&quot; SSID was not broadcasting.&nbsp; The feedback in Luci also said something was wrong with the tor SSID or it was disconnected.</p><p>4. Connect to the router with SSH.&nbsp; The password will be the &quot;root&quot; password you defined in Luci.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t made a root password, you can&#039;t SSH; therefore, make a root password and then connect SSH.</p><p>5. Install a better text editor.&nbsp; In this case, I used nano:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install nano</code></pre></div><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You have to do the update to get nano.</p><p>6. Edit the file &quot;wireless&quot; in the directory /etc/config/<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ /etc/config# nano wireless</code></pre></div><p>or<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ nano /etc/config/wireless</code></pre></div><p>7. Change your wifi settings.&nbsp; Double quotes works to encapsulate spaces and special characters.&nbsp; I suspect that single quotes cause the crash (the tor network settings had single quotes, while the OpenWRT did not).</p><p>8. Save and exit</p><p>9. Reboot the router.&nbsp; I used the command &quot;reboot&quot;.</p><p>You should see the new settings take effect.&nbsp; I connected and did a <a href="https://check.torproject.org/=">tor check</a> and it succeeded.</p><p>This is a pain in the ass, especially since getting into failsafe was tricky (for me).&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking aobut getting a Bluetooth TTL adapter to see if I can rig up a cable to get to the serial port if/when I need it.&nbsp; I think the USB port on this device should be able to supply enough power, and I can configure the pins to TX, RX, and GND.&nbsp; The adapters seem to be $5 - $10 if you get one stateside, or dirt cheap if you import them.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WertWertL33tQuestion3r</strong> on 19 Sep 2015, 00:32)</p>
