					<p>I tried the 0.9.3 version this weekend. Some patches are not needed anymore, and some need trivial changes. In addition,&nbsp; you need to change the path of one of the kernel modules in the Makefile (&quot;hal/ath_hal.ko&quot; --&gt; &quot;ath_hal/ath_hal.ko&quot; if I remembered it correctly). However, it doesn&#039;t seem to work. On the first boot, &quot;wifi detect&quot; is run to generate the default wireless config file, but that didn&#039;t produce any output.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe someone can help me here. I&#039;m trying to compile this new version of madwifi here with acoul&#039;s linked source code for an atheros target system. All seems to go peachy doing a standalone recompile of madwifi itself. did the above edit of the patch-kernel.sh file. But I&#039;m running into a few errors after that:</p><p>First hiccup it stops on patch 105-security_patch_fix saying something about a previously applied or reversed patch in ieee80211_wireless.c . When I try to tell it NOT to assume -r and not to apply anyhow, it errors out the make. Thinking more into it and considering I already did a full firmware image compile with all these packages built and whatnot, I figure this file was already patched so next round I tell it to, YES, assume -R. Ok. that completes without error.</p><p>Next hiccup after that is on 107-autoconf saying something about not finding a file to patch. in the &#039;text leading upto this&#039;, it looks to be linking back to old 0.9.2 files. More specifically files related to the atheros HAL driver named ah_osdep.c . At this point it asks me for a specific file to patch that it cannot find itself and that&#039;s where I&#039;m stuck.</p><p>Btw, this is on the absolute latest kamikaze revision (or at least should be) of 7009. I understand this is probably where my confusion is stemming from. Would be nice if someone could simply merge the new madwifi source into the svn and get it over with. What with the new features and fixes and whatnot. Sure many wouold appreciate it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t believe all-knowing forum2006 can&#039;t figure out how to patch.&nbsp; The madwifi 0.9.3 you found requires an adapted version of the &quot;120-soc_fix.patch&quot; from madwifi-ng.&nbsp; Basically you&#039;d make all of the changes the patch utility would make, by hand (or find a smart utility to make this easier), save the resultant file, and do: &quot;diff -Naur oldfile newfile &gt; soc.patch&quot; between the original version and the one you made yourself.&nbsp; You&#039;re not finished yet.&nbsp; Then you&#039;d edit the patch with vi, vim, or nano (or another text editor) and make sure it goes to the right file and directory (&quot;madwifi-0.9.3.1&quot; , not madwifi-ng-rXXXX-XXXXXXXX, and here we need the file to be &quot;if_ath_ahb.c&quot;).&nbsp; You also should need to add the &#039;Index:....&#039; so that the patch utility knows what file to patch.&nbsp; See the other patch files bundled with NG as a reference.&nbsp; If YOU ARE LAZY (or sensible, depending upon how you look at it), look to the DD-WRT forums and search for &quot;0.9.3.1&quot; or &quot;0.9.3&quot; and you will find the redone package there along with an ipkg for 2.6.21.1.<br />HERE IS THE DD-WRT THREAD:</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=87015#87015">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. … 7015#87015</a></p><p>Do not edit text files with WinSCP.&nbsp; It does not refresh automatically and leaves you with a headache.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Meltyblood</strong> on 12 Jul 2007, 22:40)</p>

					<p>This madwifi is now deprecated.&nbsp; It won&#039;t even compile under new 2.6.22.X kernels.&nbsp; The new madwifi-ng drivers seem to have taken a shift and now support packet injection without additional patches.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Meltyblood</strong> on 27 Jul 2007, 21:33)</p>
