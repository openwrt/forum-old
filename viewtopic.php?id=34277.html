					<p>Hi,</p><p>Here is a fast and simple way to put your stock firmware back on your router from any 3rd party firmware.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t found anything that is simple and fast so I put this together and this should only take you a couple of mins to do.</p><p>I have done this with the following routers and firmwares with no problems</p><p>TP Link TL-WR1034ND OpenWRT/MLPPP, OpenWRT and DD-WRT<br />TEW-632BRP v1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWRT and DD-WRT</p><p>1. download latest firmware for your routers (makes it easy to rename it to something simple like tplink.bin)<br />2. download winscp (google it its FREE)<br />3. reset your router to default settings with a hard reset<br />4. login to your router 192.168.1.1 with the SCP protocol<br />5. upload your firmware to the /tmp directory (do not change directory!)<br />6. push ctrl+t or click on commands menu than on open terminal<br />7. type this command in:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mtd -r write firmware.bin firmware&nbsp; (change firmware.bin to your bin)</p><p>*** This will install the firmware and will reboot your router and than you will get a message in winscp that you are not connected to the router this is normal and good.&nbsp; Once the router has been rebooted close winscp and continue</p><p>8. go back to your browser and login to your router with the stock firmware<br />9. IMPORTANT now use the stock firmware webgui upgrade option to rewrite the stock firmware or you can have the option to switch to another 3rd party firmware, but you MUST write the firmware again with the webgui<br />10.
