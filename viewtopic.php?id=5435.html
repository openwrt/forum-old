					<p>I am searching for the easiest way to install rc5 for a special documentation. This thread is quite similar, so I continue here - the router is an Asus WL-500g - on the router there was the lastest software from Oleg (modified Asus Firmware). The router was configured with 192.168.0.1. The uploading computer was in dhcp mode.<br />I started the recovery modus with the Asus recoverytool, loaded the default image with the webinterface, found the webinterface under <a href="http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/webif/system.sh">http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/webif/system.sh</a><br />I was told to set my password. There was the described error on the asus router - the same as with telnet &quot;passwd: An error occurred updating the password file.&quot; - I did a hard reboot - unplugging the the electricity - found the webinterface again, set the password again and then a well known screen of firefox appeard - page not found. Here everything stopped. I did not find the webinterface any more, and could not connect nither with telnet nore with ssh. I only could restore the old firmware.</p><p>So do you think, this is a possible way for installation - to use only the webinterface without telnet and ssh? Is it necessary, that the IP of the router is set to 192.168.1.1 before uploading ?&nbsp; Somebody in another forum told me, that the password must be set with telnet - afterwards it will be possible to continue with the webinterface?</p><p>thx kultex</p>									</div>

					<p>I hope I&#039;m placing this post in a good location here. I think this thread is unresolved . . .</p><p>I have a brand new Linksys WRT54GL (v1.1) and I&#039;ve just flashed it with openwrt-wrt54g-2.4-squashfs.bin per the instructions here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/linksys/wrt54gl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … ys/wrt54gl</a><br />(&quot;Using the Linksys web GUI&quot; section.)</p><p>I checked the mp5sums -- successfully.<br />I installed OpenWRT -- successfully.<br />I telnet&#039;ed and set the password -- successfully.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/configuring">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/configuring</a></p><p>When I tried to get back in, though, via ssh, the password won&#039;t work.

It seems that it is wanting a different password, but the one I just set doesn&#039;t work (yes, I waited a while and rebooted the router -- twice now) and none of the others, &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;root&quot; or null work either.</p><p>Is ssh supposed to be using a different password?</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/configuring">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/configuring</a><br />says I can login via the web interface (LUCI) with a username &quot;root&quot;, but that didn&#039;t work.
