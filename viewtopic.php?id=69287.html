					<p>I see your confusion after looking at the articles</p><p>The difference between the factory and upgrade is that the factory is used to upgrade from the stock factory firmware to OpenWrt and the upgrade from an older to newer version of OpenWrt.</p><p>You want the factory file for the wdr-3600.</p><p>Regarding the flashing instructions, I do NOT suggest you upgrade to the latest TP-Link firmware per step 1.&nbsp; I do not know for sure, but TP-Link was making it hard to upgrade to anything other than their firmware to comply with FCC regulations.&nbsp; It is also not clear on what happens during the flashing process.&nbsp; It may reboot to OpenWrt or it may appear to be dead.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; Wait at least five minutes if things appear to stop processing.&nbsp; Then unplug and replug the power.&nbsp; </p><p>Read this too:&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a>&nbsp; </p><p>It is not clear what the exact format of the name needs to be to upgrade, but you can download a bin from here <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/us/download/TL-WDR3600.html#Firmware">http://www.tp-link.com/us/download/TL-W … l#Firmware</a> and use the file name to rename your OpenWrt file to pass the checks I expect.&nbsp; The 3/2/2015 firmware name is this:&nbsp; <br />wdr3600v1_en_3_14_1_up_boot(150302).bin&nbsp; but you may want to verify</p><p>I have not tried this so can not tell you if it will work, but reading the 4300 wiki it sounds like it should install if you can pass the name test.&nbsp; Be safe, disconnect from the internet and use only the single client needed to manage the process.</p><p>it is too bad these simple instructions are not in the 3600 wiki.&nbsp; You may also want to search the wiki for wdr3600 and see if this is covered elsewhere.</p><p>Please confirm to this post if you succeed and include the name you used as well as the system responses\times\actions you had to perform to get to the first login.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here&#039;s a twist - I already have a dd-wrt installed on the router.</p><p>I tried downloading the &quot;factory&quot; bin file, and used the dd-wrt web flash interface, and it did something but returned me to the dd-wrt installation again, which I guess means either the flashing failed or nothing happened.</p><p>Any thoughts on how to proceed? Like you said, I don&#039;t want to flash to the stock firmware from TP-LINK first, since I have read bad things about newer TP-LINK firmwares.</p><br /><p>EDIT: Why the heck do I keep seeing &quot;Too more links in message. Allowed 0 links&quot;. Fine, if only 0 links are allowed, don&#039;t create links in my message. Why are you creating a link and then complaining that there are too many links?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is more of a dd-wrt question.&nbsp; Whatever process they have to go back to stock firmware should also work with a &quot;factory&quot; OpenWrt.&nbsp; I think you can also use the dd-wrt command line to directly mtd an image into the flash (that would be a sysupgrade) but that is risky.</p><p>New users aren&#039;t allowed to post links, as an anti-spam measure.</p>									</div>

					<p>hello, I have a similar confusion about the Wiki page:wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</p><p>I have v1.1 version of the router, so I am confused if the only version of openwrt supported is AA 12.09 or can I also install CC 15.05. Right now I have AA 12.09 installed and running fine. I want to try some QOS and have tried wshaper but want isnt working well and would like to try some other packages (sqm etc), but I believe those are in BB and CC?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
