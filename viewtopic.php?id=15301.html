					<p>since I have couple of those broadcom routers working on some production links over at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Wireless_Metropolitan_Network">awmn</a>, that no longer boot with latest kamikaze, I started to maintain a kamikaze svn 6553 based branch on linux-2.6.19.7 kernel and with latest patches on toolchain &amp; packages.&nbsp; It is not perfect but does the job it is supposed to do.&nbsp; You can get it <a href="http://wifi.ozo.com/airo/openwrt/firmware/kamikaze/2.6/rt220/">here</a> along with some extra packages <a href="http://wifi.ozo.com/airo/openwrt/packages/ozonet-rt220/">here</a>.</p><p>please note that I do not use broadcom wifi cards as they have no open source support and their radio quality is very poor. the above branch offers good support for atheros 802.11a/b/g cards and the older prism2/2.5 wifi cards through hostap driver.&nbsp; if you are looking for wifi broadcom support this branch is not for you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>acoul</strong> on 11 Oct 2008, 10:27)</p>
