					<p>Hi Guys, </p><p>This is my first post on here and that mainly due to me having several of the TG582n routers. It would be great if Openwrt could be used on this router as this is now quite a common router here in the UK and a lot of service providers now send this router out. </p><p>So I would be more than happy to work with some one on this as a project. I have access to a couple of these routers and am aware of at least 3 different variants of these. Also due to my job i have access to the wholesale firmware as well.</p><p>So will personally will be giving this ago, however this is my first project of this kind so would appreciate any help that would be available.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK Like Foster82, this is my first post to the forum. I have a Technicolor TG582n from Direct Save, a UK based ISP. I had decided not to use it as I already had a working router with all my settings for DMZ, port forwarding etc. Unfortunately my existing router just went bang. I&#039;ve readjusted the IP ranges of my firewall to work with the TG582n but the router is locked down and I can&#039;t access it to finnese the settings. I&#039;m hoping that OpenWRT is the solution, but I need to know how to get the firmware onto a locked box. Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Many Thanks</p><p>JB</p>									</div>

					<p>As with other Thomson routers, probably the best way to install OpenWrt isfirst to replace the bootloader for a custom one. Sourcecode for building BCM6328 CFE is available somewhere in internet.</p><p>If JTAG doesn&#039;t allow to flash the bootloader this isn&#039;t a problem. These boards use an SPI flash memory. It&#039;s a piece of cake to flash a flash chip memory, you only need to wire 6 pins.

					<p>As danitool suggested, I hooked up the flash memory to a raspberry pi and can read and write to it. At first, however, I wired the connections wrong and the chip got really hot. After that the router now cannot power up (the serial line shows nothing, the LEDs don&#039;t flash during POST).</p><p>For anyone else that wants to brick their router, I did the following:</p><p>On the raspberry follow this to <a href="http://www.brianhensley.net/2012/07/getting-spi-working-on-raspberry-pi.html">get the SPI working</a>. You will need <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/spi/spidev_test.c?id=95b1ed2ac7ffe3205afc6f5a20320fbdb984da92">this piece of code</a> instead of the current one linked in the post. Then install flashrom.</p><p>Connect 8 pins from the chip to the raspberry. I have <a href="http://www.spansion.com/Support/Datasheets/S25FL129P_00.pdf">SPANSION S25FL129P (variant 0)</a>. For the RPI I use <a href="http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout">this layout information</a>. So the connection looks like <a href="http://imgur.com/I0JSWpL">this table</a>. (the forum&#039;s bbcode don&#039;t recognize tables?)</p><p>After you&#039;ve loaded the SPI kernel module on the RPI, tested it works, installed flashrom and *connected the pins correctly*, dump the contents of the flash to a file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  machine# ./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0 -c &quot;S25FL129P......0&quot; -r flash_0.data</code></pre></div><p>danitool, do you have more info where I can CFE sources with a BCM63281 build target?

					<p>I have got a working Openwrt on my TG582n router with the help from the community and google(Thanks!), although I only have the features I want included in the build thus can&#039;t gurantee all the features will work, I still want to share what I have done in case it benifits anybody. The source with TG582n support can be found at git@github.com:kplus/openwrt-tg582n.git</p><p>Apart from the Openwrt firmware image, you will also need CFE to override ISP&#039;s bootloader.</p><p>The steps I have taken are:</p><p>1. flash the CFE bootloader into the flash(using FTDI programmer)<br />2. short-circuit R62 and R63 on the router, and connect to serial port, baudrate set to 115200<br />3. connect the route to PC with an Ethernet cable, and set the ip of PC to static 192.168.1.100<br />4. power on the router, and interrupt bootloader by press anykey during booting.<br />5. open 192.168.1.1 in browser and upload Openwrt CFE image.<br />6. router will reboot automatically after flashing, and then you should be able to login through the serial console.</p><p>Hope this helps. <br />Enjoy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qiushengfu</strong> on 17 Jul 2015, 23:22)</p>

					<p>thanks for the reply qiushengfu , i will try it your way .<br />for a week i have been trying to find ways to put an openwrt firmware over my tg582n without success .<br />I am using a jtag connection directly to the chip with a blackcat usb jtag .<br />I was able to extract the full flash from the chip and decompile it , but when i recompile again and program it on tg582n it just dont work .<br />I am even unable to change the serial number and flash the original firmware i grabbed , because somehow there is an ssl certificate connected to a specific serial number of the device , changing a number on the serial then it wont work .</p><p>To be able to detect the right ID of chip i had to use an external 3,3v power source , i used my raspberry .<br />Here are some pictures from my progress and findings until now .</p><p>Jtaging tg582n with external power source :<br /><a href="http://s3.postimg.org/xsv63aiub/DSCF1813.jpg">http://s3.postimg.org/xsv63aiub/DSCF1813.jpg</a></p><p>then i was able to detect the proper chip with blackcat jtag programmer , and i flashed the CFE .<br /><a href="http://s21.postimg.org/93bq7xlaf/Image6.jpg">http://s21.postimg.org/93bq7xlaf/Image6.jpg</a></p><p>of course without success .</p><p>Then i started to think to change the serial numbel of the device , but everytime i did , then router wont start .<br />so i opened the bin to lookup :<br /><a href="http://s29.postimg.org/5pzpal6kn/thssl.jpg">http://s29.postimg.org/5pzpal6kn/thssl.jpg</a><br />i notice the ssl certificate must be related to this issue , but i never figured out how to solve this problem .</p><p>So , i decided to extract the complete binary file :<br /><a href="http://s3.postimg.org/r0symtm6r/firmware_mod_kit_trunk_001.jpg">http://s3.postimg.org/r0symtm6r/firmwar … nk_001.jpg</a></p><p>to try to unblock modem to a specific ISP , but when i recompile the firmware again and programm it then it wont work .<br />On compilation tells me that header is not compatible .</p><p>Anyway , this is my story until now .<br />I will try your way on next weekend to see if it works .</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tested qiushengfu solution without success .<br />I compiled BCM chipset using the git clone , their options are only 6338 cpu as minimum , and you are not able to compile for 63281 cpu .<br />What happens is that when you flash that cfe on the flash and start the device , nothing will happen , it stays dead .<br />I was looking at the flashed bin on the device using a jtag programmer and only 0000 were flashed , i can see the result of the programming in hex format on the programmer .<br />i have used blackcat 3.40 version to flash the chip .<br />The only way until now that worked , is to re-flash the original firmware that was previous in the device from ISP , or flashing a similar firmware from an identical model .</p><p>the git that have the bcm63xx is in here :<br /><a href="https://github.com/kplus/cfe_bcm63xx">https://github.com/kplus/cfe_bcm63xx</a></p><p>and in the instructions you have to compile your cpu model , not all 3 .</p><p>you have 3 options :<br />1 - make BRCM_CHIP=6338<br />2 - make BRCM_CHIP=6348<br />3 - make BRCM_CHIP=6358</p><p>but the chipset 6328 is not there , and even if you try to compile it&nbsp; , you will get a considerable ammount of errors and will get you nowhere .<br />the example i just said was this :<br />make BRCM_CHIP=6328&nbsp; &nbsp;, but it wont work .</p><p>Also in the build script , there are by default a compilation for another cpu :<br /><a href="https://github.com/kplus/cfe_bcm63xx/blob/master/build.sh">https://github.com/kplus/cfe_bcm63xx/bl … r/build.sh</a></p><p>&quot;cd cfe/build/broadcom/bcm63xx_rom</p><p>make clean<br />make BRCM_CHIP=6348&quot;</p><p>witch is pointing the build to 6348 cpu no matter what you choose .</p><p>anyone could give an help in this one ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pedropt</strong> on 15 Aug 2015, 03:32)</p>
