					<p>Does anyone else think that the OpenWrt home page is in a bad state? Here&#039;s the situation from my viewpoint:</p><p>The home page of OpenWrt - one of the premier open-source projects - fails to offer good information about the project. Despite the fact that thousands of people regularly use and contribute to the project, the home page has major failings:</p><p>* There&#039;s precious little introductory material that&#039;s welcoming to newcomers. <br />* Much of the information presented is of marginal interest to other readers. <br />* The formatting is bad - it looks hastily thrown together.<br />* Updates only occur when one of the heavily-overburdened core developers has a moment to post a notice. <br />* And because those updates are so infrequent, much of the &quot;news&quot; on the site is many, many years old.</p><p>I realize that team that controls the home page and top-level pages of the wiki might not want those pages changed by any random poster. But I would encourage them to consider handing off responsibility to a small team of volunteers. There are plenty of us who would take on those duties. Thanks.</p><p>Update: I just posted a note to the developer ticket database that contains the requests on this subject that we made in an email back in July 2015. <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/22017">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/22017</a></p><p>PS I just learned more about how the home page gets constructed <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=314385#p314385">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 85#p314385</a> (thanks, hnyman)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 11 Mar 2016, 18:01)</p>

					<p>I would strongly propose to host the web-site at github pages with or without use of Jekyll with 5-6 active developers authorized to approve pull requests. That way it would be a minimal distraction for developers and sort of barrier for everyone and their dog making changes.</p>									</div>
