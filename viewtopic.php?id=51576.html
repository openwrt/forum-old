					<p>Hello,<br />I currently have a Linksys WRT54g v2.0 running the latest version of Barrier Breaker, and I would like to access its GPIO ports. I have followed the directions presented on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.gpio">this wiki page</a> for controlling GPIO from the shell, but every time I attempt to export the pins, I receive this error:<br />&quot;ash: write error: Device or resource busy&quot;<br />This occurs for every pin except pin 4. I can&#039;t find any explanation of what might be causing this and how to alleviate this problem. Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, I didn&#039;t realize there were more GPIO lines than listed on the wiki page. I need four lines to connect to an SPI device that I am using as a servomotor controller. I was under the impression that exporting the ports released them from their previous uses, is this not the case? The page on the wiki stated that the ports used by the ADM switch were only used during the boot process, and would not be used after that.</p><p>If I do need to use ports 8 and up, do you know where they might be located on the board?</p>									</div>

					<p>One last question, as I am still confused. Are the pins used by the ADM switch being used after booting up? If not, i would really like get the kernel to let me use them, as I do know where they are located.</p>									</div>

					<p>Check it out by yourself: <a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=blob;f=target/linux/generic/files/drivers/net/phy/adm6996.c">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a … /adm6996.c</a></p><p>I still have no idea why does it matter if the GPIOs are used during boot only. Let&#039;s say they are. After booting they stay connected to the switch, right? So you can&#039;t re-use them for anything else I believe. Unless you want to remove switch support completely.</p>									</div>

					<p>No idea how switch behaves by default, without any reset/config.</p><p>I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t be able to have separated &quot;WAN&quot; port and &quot;LAN&quot; ports.</p>									</div>
